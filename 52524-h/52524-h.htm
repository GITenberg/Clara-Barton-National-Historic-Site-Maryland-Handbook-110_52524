<h3 id="c2">A Look at the Past</h3>
<p>Clara Barton, humanitarian and
founder of the American Red Cross,
spent the last 15 years of her life in a
house in Glen Echo, Maryland, now
known as Clara Barton National Historic
Site. Here her contributions to
American life and her personal
achievements are memorialized.
Here you can see many of her personal
effects and some of the awards
given to her. Here, too, you can
learn of the substance of her life and
see how she lived and worked.</p>
<p>From Glen Echo, you can go on to
several other National Park System
sites associated with Clara Barton:
Antietam, Andersonville, Manassas,
Fredericksburg, and Johnstown. Together
these diverse sites document
her life, her work, and her legacy.
Begin here at her house and fill in
details of her life as you come across
them at the other sites. For example,
the lumber you see in the building at
Glen Echo was originally used as
temporary housing for victims of the
Johnstown, Pennsylvania, flood in
1889. After Clara Barton and the
Red Cross finished helping the injured
and the homeless in that city,
the structure was dismantled and
shipped to Washington, D.C. Two
years later, the materials were used
at Glen Echo to construct a national
headquarters for the American Red
Cross.</p>
<p>The new building had essentially
the same lines as the Johnstown
structure with various alterations to
accommodate the needs of the
American Red Cross and Clara Barton
herself.</p>
<p>Initially she planned to use this
building as a warehouse for American
Red Cross supplies. Six years
after its construction, the building
was remodeled and used not only as
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
a warehouse, but also as the headquarters
of the new organization and
as the residence for her and her staff.
The structure served all purposes
well. Clara Barton did not distinguish
between herself and the organization
she founded. The lines were blurred;
she was the Red Cross, and the Red
Cross was Clara Barton. That is evident
here in the house, for she did
not separate living space from working
space. The building&rsquo;s purposes
merged in its principal resident.</p>
<p>Using the place as a home, Clara
Barton learned to love the passage of
the seasons, to enjoy the way the
light came in at different times of the
year, to plant the yard and garden
the way she wanted. As a headquarters
and warehouse for the Red
Cross, the building served her well,
too. She met there with many dignitaries
and volunteers on Red Cross
business and stored supplies for potential
disasters. Her home and office
testify to her complete and unequivocal
devotion to the Red Cross.</p>
<p>Less sharply focused is Clara Barton&rsquo;s
role in women&rsquo;s rights. Miss
Barton was neither a traditional
woman nor a radical feminist, although
Susan B. Anthony and Harriet
Austin were friends. She did not
repudiate the traditional roles for
women. Instead she succeeded in enlarging
that accepted sphere so that
the traditional skills of women&mdash;teaching
children, nursing the sick&mdash;became
acceptable in the public
sphere. Clara Barton argued for
women&rsquo;s equality and believed in
their right to vote. But concern for
her fledgling organization overrode
her dedication to women&rsquo;s rights and
all other causes.</p>
<p>At her home and office in Glen
Echo you can begin to sense this
complex, fascinating individual: the
public and private person so inextricably
intertwined. You sense the
space in which Clara Barton moved,
worked, and thought. Impressions
coalesce into an image. And yet that
image cannot become distinct without
understanding her many ideas,
desires, and efforts noted in her diaries,
letters, and papers. This handbook
tells the story of her eventful
90 years. The next few pages contain
a brief chronology of her life and
times. Part 2 provides a full-length
biographical essay by historian Elizabeth
Brown Pryor. Barton in both
triumph and defeat is here for the
reader to accept, reject, or wonder
at. Many of her own words are here
to explain more fully what she was
thinking&mdash;and worrying&mdash;about. The
biography amplifies the chronology,
making it come alive with the whims
and inconsistencies of human nature.
It&rsquo;s a book within a book. And Part
3 is a guide to sites, managed by the
National Park Service and other public
and private organizations, associated
with Clara Barton and her career.</p>
<p>Together the three parts of this
handbook provide a clear image of
one of the most outstanding women
of the 19th century, Clara Barton.</p>

<h3 id="c5">Square as a Brick</h3>
<p>As a woman of 87, Clara Barton remembered
&ldquo;nothing but fear&rdquo; when
she looked back to her childhood.
She portrayed herself as an introspective,
insecure child, too timid to
express her thoughts to others. Yet
this girl who felt terror in all new situations
possessed the qualities that
enabled her to overcome that fear,
indeed to become the woman most
universally acclaimed as courageous
in American history.</p>
<p>Her childhood was unusual. She
was born on December 25, 1821, in
North Oxford, Massachusetts, and
named Clarissa Harlowe Barton after
an aunt, who in turn had been
named for a popular novel of her
day. Her parents, Capt. Stephen
Barton and Sarah Stone Barton, had
four other children, all at least 10
years of age by the time this child
was born. Thus Clara&mdash;as she was always
called&mdash;was born into a world
of adults and, as she later recalled,
&ldquo;had no playmates, but in effect six
fathers and mothers.&rdquo; She might well
have added &ldquo;six teachers,&rdquo; for she
noted that &ldquo;all took charge of me, all
educated me according to personal
taste.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig27">
<img src="images/img005.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="741" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Sarah Stone Barton was a
native New Englander and was
born in 1787. She married at
age 17, and in her first seven
years of marriage, she gave
birth to her first four children.
The last, Clara, followed after
a ten-year interval.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Sally Barton, her mother, was an
erratic, nervous woman, with a reputation
for profanity and a violent
temper. She vented her frustrations
in compulsive housework, and Clara
Barton later recalled that her mother
&ldquo;never slept after 3 o&rsquo;clock in the
morning&rdquo; and &ldquo;always did two days
work in one.&rdquo; Sally Barton spent little
time with her youngest daughter,
preferring to leave her with other
family members. Thus Clara Barton
learned political and military lore
from her father, mathematics from
her brother Stephen, and horseback
riding from brother David. Her two
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
sisters, Sally and Dolly, concentrated
on teaching her academic subjects.
Besides this household instruction,
she attended both private and public
schools in the Oxford area.</p>
<p>She was a serious child, anxious to
learn, but timid to try. Her later
reminiscences of childhood were
filled with stories of frightful thunderstorms,
intimidating schools, encounters
with snakes, and crippling
illnesses. When she was six her sister
Dolly, who had been an intellectual
girl, became mentally unbalanced,
and the family had to lock her in a
room with barred windows. Once
Dolly escaped and chased David&rsquo;s
wife, Julia, around the yard with an
ax in her hand. Clara Barton never
publicly mentioned her sister&rsquo;s insanity,
but she privately thought the illness
had been brought on by Dolly&rsquo;s
unfulfilled desire to obtain a higher
education. This rather frantic home-life
and the presence of Dolly in the
Barton household must have added
greatly to her timidity and to her
later emotional instability.</p>
<p>Barton developed great loyalty for
her family, eccentric as they were.
On one occasion she nursed her
brother David for two years after he
was seriously injured in a fall. Later
she used her political influence to assist
family members; for example, to
defend a cousin&rsquo;s job or to secure
suitable military appointment for a
relative. Throughout her life she was
a faithful correspondent, continually
interested in the affairs of nephews,
nieces, cousins, brothers, and sisters.
And in later years she described her
family life in glowing terms, never
mentioning her mother&rsquo;s tantrums or
Dolly&rsquo;s insanity. Her devotion also
extended to family friends.</p>
<p>The Bartons were quintessentially
industrious. David and Stephen Barton
were businessmen, successful pioneers
of milling techniques. Clara
Barton&rsquo;s two sisters taught school; a
cousin became the first woman Post
Office official in Worcester County,
Massachusetts. Such diligence was
one of the great influences in Clara
Barton&rsquo;s life. &ldquo;You have never
known me without work,&rdquo; she wrote
when in her eighties, &ldquo;and you never
will. It has always been a part of the
best religion I had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She began work early. She had
been an intellectually precocious
child and by her late teens was competent
to teach. She first taught in
the Oxford schools, and later she
conducted classes for the children of
workers in the Barton family mills.
In these one-room schools she gained
a reputation for first-rate scholarship
and excellent discipline. She expelled
and whipped students when necessary,
but mostly she cajoled them
into obedience through affection and
respect. When her first school won
the district&rsquo;s highest marks for discipline,
she remonstrated: &ldquo;I thought it
the greatest injustice ... [for] there
had been no discipline.... Child
that I was, I did not know that the
surest test of discipline is its
absence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barton was introspective and
keenly aware of herself as an individual,
and this enabled her to view her
students individually. She gave them
such personal attention that scores of
former pupils wrote to her in later
years, confident that their uniqueness
had touched her. Barton in turn
called her pupils &ldquo;my boys&rdquo; and
made no apologies for her loyalty.
&ldquo;They were all mine,&rdquo; she recalled
in the second part of her autobiography,
&ldquo;second only to the claims and
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
interests of the real mother.... And
so they had remained. Scattered over
the world, some near, some far, I
have been their confidant.... I
count little in comparison with the
faithful grateful love I hold today of
the few survivors of my Oxford
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Teaching thus reinforced her loyalty
and her sense of individuality. Her
excellence as an instructor also had
the effect of mitigating her introversion
and strengthening her self-assurance.
Indeed, she became confident
enough to teach the roughest district
schools and to demand pay equal to
a man&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I may sometimes be willing
to teach for nothing,&rdquo; she told
one school board, &ldquo;but if paid at all,
I shall never do a man&rsquo;s work for less
than a man&rsquo;s pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1850, after more than ten years
of successful teaching, she felt compelled
to &ldquo;find a school ... to teach
<i>me</i> something.&rdquo; Female academies
were rare. She settled upon the Clinton
Liberal Institute in Clinton, New
York, and took as many classes as
possible in her course.</p>
<p>The institute was, in many ways,
an ideal academy for Barton. The
school&rsquo;s liberal philosophy and broad
approach to education for women
corresponded with her family&rsquo;s liberal
traditions and her own political
and religious feelings. Moreover, the
climate of New England and New
York in the 1830s and 1840s was one
of intellectual and moral progressiveness:
Horace Mann instituted far-reaching
educational reforms in Massachusetts;
Ralph Waldo Emerson
wrote about the philosophic basis of
human liberty; religion lost its evangelistic
approach; William Lloyd
Garrison expounded on the plight of
the enslaved black; and a few women
such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton realized
that their position was little better
than that of slaves and protested
against it.</p>
<p>None of this activity was lost on
Clara Barton, who possessed an innate
sense of honesty and justice.
She became an early advocate of
rights for women. &ldquo;I must have been
born believing,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;in the
full right of woman to all the privileges
and positions which nature and
justice accord her in common with
other human beings. Perfectly equal
rights&mdash;human rights. There was
never any question in my mind in regard
to this.&rdquo; She supported the
cause of woman suffrage, for she
maintained that while a woman was
denied the vote she &ldquo;had no rights
and ... must submit to wrongs, and
because she submits to wrongs she
isn&rsquo;t anybody.&rdquo; Yet she steadfastly
asserted her rights and deemed it
&ldquo;ridiculous that any sensible, rational
person should question it.&rdquo; Although
she did not participate in women&rsquo;s
rights rallies until later in her life,
she always acted on her principles. In
February 1861, for example, Barton
began to champion the cause of her
cousin, Elvira Stone, a postmistress
who was about to lose her job to a
man. Barton laid the unpleasant facts
before her friends in Washington
without hesitation: &ldquo;As Cousin Elvira
had never taken any parts [<i>sic</i>]
in politics ... political tendencies
can scarcely be made a pretext, neither
incompetence, neglect of business,
location or lack of a proper recognition
of, or attention to, the
wants of the community in any manner&mdash;And
it would not <i>look well</i> to
commence a petition with <i>Mankind</i>
being naturally prone to selfishness
we hereby etc., etc.&mdash;And I have
been able to divine nothing except
that she is guilty of being a woman.&rdquo;
By April she had secured her
cousin&rsquo;s position. She dryly remarked
that Elvira Stone was certainly entitled
to it, for, &ldquo;I have never learned
that the [post office] proceeds arising
from the female portion of the correspondence
of our country were deducted
from the revenue.&rdquo;</p>

In later years Clara
Barton referred to him as the
&ldquo;Buffalo Bill of the neighborhood&rdquo;
when recalling the
events of her childhood. David
and his brother Stephen owned
and operated a satinet mill:
satinet was a kind of cotton
cloth.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Barton felt that by winning such
small battles, her larger feminist
principles were upheld. But her real
contribution in these early years was
her own attitude and actions. By
demonstrating that her talents, courage,
and intellect were undeniably
equal to a man&rsquo;s she quietly furthered
the women&rsquo;s cause as much as
parades and speeches did. &ldquo;As for
my being a woman,&rdquo; she told the
men who questioned her, &ldquo;[you] will
get used to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her interest in the extension of liberties
for women was not selfishly inspired.
Rather it was a product of
her deep-rooted sense of integrity
and fairness. She believed rigidly in
human rights, especially in the rights
of those unable to defend or help
themselves. &ldquo;What is everybody&rsquo;s
business is nobody&rsquo;s business,&rdquo; Barton
once declared. &ldquo;What is
nobody&rsquo;s business is my business.&rdquo;
Her advocacy of equality colored her
political views.</p>
<p>Neither could Barton tolerate dishonesty
and petty arrogance. More
than once during the Civil War she
railed against &ldquo;the conduct of improper,
heartless, unfaithful Union
officers&rdquo; who blithely ignored the
plight of the &ldquo;dirty, lousy, common
soldiers.&rdquo; She expected high standards
of politicians, soldiers, and
schoolboys alike. Once when a former
pupil had misused some money
she had entrusted to him, she lamented:
&ldquo;I am less grieved by the
loss than I am about his manner of
treating my trust.... I am as square
as a brick and I expect my boys to be
square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1852, Barton demonstrated the
sincerity of her principles in a dramatic
way. She left Clinton to stay
with a schoolmate near Bordentown,
New Jersey, and taught at a private
subscription school, for there were
no free public schools. She felt uneasy
about the numbers of children
whose parents could not afford private
instruction, and she began to agitate
for a free school. But the popular
view was that free schools were a
form of charity. She refused to give
in and eventually swayed the local
school board. A small house was outfitted,
and she began to lead one of
the first free schools in the state.</p>
<p>The Bordentown free school was a
pronounced success. In its first year
the number of pupils rose from 6 to
600, and the town built a new school-house.
The town, however, could not
accept a woman as the head of a
school of 600 pupils and a man was
named principal. She became his assistant.
&ldquo;I could bear the ingratitude,
but not the pettiness and jealousy of
this principal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether the pettiness was real or
imagined, Barton could not endure a
secondary position. While she debated
resignation, her nerves gave
way, causing a case of laryngitis.
Early in 1854, she resigned and left
for Washington, D.C., where she
hoped to improve her health and &ldquo;do
something decided&rdquo; with her newly
realized &ldquo;courage and tolerable faculty
of winning [her] way with
strangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barton&rsquo;s health did improve in
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
Washington, and she was soon able
to &ldquo;do something decided.&rdquo; Charles
Mason, the commissioner of patents,
hired her as a clerk. At this time no
women were permanently employed
by the Federal Government though
previously there had been. Most officials
agreed with Secretary of the Interior
Robert McClelland who declared
that there was an &ldquo;obvious
impropriety in the mixing of the two
sexes within the walls of a public office.&rdquo;
She gained the confidence of
Commissioner Mason, however, and
became his most competent and
trusted clerk. Moreover, she combatted
the many dishonest clerks who
sold patent privileges illegally. The
whole affair, she concluded, made
quite a commotion, and the clerks
&ldquo;tried to make it too hard for me. It
wasn&rsquo;t a very pleasant experience; in
fact it was very trying, but I thought
perhaps there was some question of
principle involved and I lived through
it.&rdquo;</p>

held several public offices
before becoming President in
1857. He was a member of the
Pennsylvania House of Representatives
and of the U.S.
House of Representatives and
Senate. He was secretary of
state for James K. Polk and
ambassador to Great Britain
during the Presidency of Franklin
Pierce. As President he felt
powerless to deal with the
States that seceded in the last
months of his administration
though he abhorred their
actions. He retired to his home
in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Although she lost her job at the
Patent Office under the Buchanan
administration in 1856, Barton was
reappointed late in 1860. She enjoyed
living in Washington, for she
was fascinated by politics and liked
knowing such prominent figures as
Massachusetts Senator Henry Wilson.
She often sat in the Senate gallery
to watch the proceedings and became
astute and well-informed on
political matters.</p>
<p>Clara Barton was still a clerk at
the Patent Office when the Civil War
began. Like many other intelligent
and independent women of her day,
she was often filled with restless discontent,
probably stemming from
having more to give than life demanded.
Her job as Patent Office
clerk demanded little but self-effacement
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
and neat penmanship. The conflict
that arose in 1861 provided her
with an outlet for her energy and satisfied
her longing to lose herself in
her work and to be needed.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>When President Lincoln issued
his call for volunteers to maintain
the Union, the response
was immediate and troops began
heading for Washington.
Some Massachusetts volunteers
passing through Baltimore,
which was decidedly
Southern in sentiment, were
attacked by local citizens.</i></p>
</div>
<p>In late April 1861, less than two
weeks after the bombardment of Fort
Sumter in South Carolina, the Massachusetts
Sixth Regiment arrived in
Washington, D.C., from Massachusetts.
This regiment hailed from the
Worcester area and many of the men
were friends or former pupils of
Clara Barton. Their train was
mobbed while passing through Baltimore,
and Barton, concerned that
one of her &ldquo;boys&rdquo; might have been
injured, rushed to their temporary
quarters in the Senate Chamber. She
found the Regiment unharmed, but
sadly lacking in basic necessities&mdash;&ldquo;towels
and handkerchiefs ... serving
utensils, thread, needles ...
etc.&rdquo; She bought and distributed as
many of these items as she could,
then wrote to the anxious families in
Massachusetts to send preserved
fruits, blankets, candles, and other
supplies to supplement the unreliable
army issues. &ldquo;It is <i>said</i> upon proper
authority, that &lsquo;our army is supplied,&rsquo;&rdquo;
she wrote to a group of ladies
in Worcester, &ldquo;how this can be
so I fail to see.&rdquo; When the generous
New Englanders inundated her with
useful articles and stores, Barton&rsquo;s
home became a virtual warehouse.
&ldquo;It may be in these days of quiet
idleness they have really no pressing
wants,&rdquo; she observed, &ldquo;but in the
event of a battle who can tell what
their needs might grow to in a single
day?&rdquo; Such garnering of supplies
against unforeseen disaster eventually
became a central characteristic of
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
her relief work in the years to come.</p>
<p>Barton&rsquo;s earliest concern with aiding
the Union army stemmed from
her loyalty to the Massachusetts
men. She felt a personal involvement
with those who &ldquo;only a few years ago
came every morning ... and took
their places quietly and happily
among my scholars&rdquo; and an allegiance
to others from her home
state. &ldquo;They formed and crowded
around me,&rdquo; she noted. &ldquo;What could
I do but go with them, or work for
them and my country? The patriot
blood of my father was warm in my
veins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her patriotism also was aroused by
the Union cause. Although she maintained
that the purpose of the war
was not solely to abolish slavery, she
also held little sympathy for the
Southern way of life and aligned herself
with such Republicans as Henry
Wilson who believed that historically
the Southern states had conspired to
tyrannize the North. &ldquo;Independence!&rdquo;
she once scoffed, &ldquo;they always
had their independence till they
madly threw it away.&rdquo; She was exhilarated.
&ldquo;This conflict is one thing
I&rsquo;ve been waiting for,&rdquo; she told a
friend, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m well and strong and
young&mdash;young enough to go to the
front. If I can&rsquo;t be a soldier I&rsquo;ll help
soldiers.&rdquo; And feeling even more exalted,
she declared that &ldquo;when there
is no longer a soldier&rsquo;s arm to raise
the Stars and Stripes above our Capitol,
may God give strength to mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a year Barton contented herself
with soliciting supplies. Then, as
the horrible effects of battle were reported
in Washington, she began to
think of aiding soldiers directly on
the battlefield. She had visited hospitals
and invalid camps, but what disturbed
her most were the tales of
suffering at the front. Soldiers often
had wounds unnecessarily complicated
by infection due to neglect, or
died of thirst while waiting for transportation
to field hospitals. Nurses
were urgently needed at the battlefield,
but she wondered if it was
seemly for a woman to place herself
directly in the lines of battle: &ldquo;I
struggled ... with my sense of propriety,
with the appalling fact that I
was only a woman whispering in one
ear, and thundering in the other
[were] the groans of suffering men
dying like dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her father encouraged her to go
where her conscience directed. When
Captain Barton died in March 1862,
she felt that her duties to the family
had closed. She petitioned Massachusetts
Gov. John Andrew and other
government officials for permission
to join General Burnside&rsquo;s division at
the front. Late in the summer of
1862, at the Battle of Cedar Mountain,
Virginia, she &ldquo;broke the shackles
and went to the field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Cedar Mountain, and the subsequent
second battle of Bull Run,
she began a remarkable service
which continued to the end of the
war. Here, for the first of many
times, Barton and her &ldquo;precious
freights&rdquo; were transported in railroad
cars or by heavy, jolting army wagons
to a scene of utter desolation and
confusion. When she arrived at Bull
Run, 3,000 wounded men were lying
in a sparsely wooded field on straw,
for there was no other bedding. Most
had not eaten all day; many faced
amputations or other operations. She
was unprepared for such carnage, but
she distributed coffee, crackers, and
the few other supplies she had
brought. With calico skirt pinned up
around her waist, she moved among
the men and prayed that the combination
of lighted candles and dry
straw would not result in a fire that
would engulf them.</p>

<p>Scanty as her supplies were, Barton&rsquo;s
aid was timely and competent.
An army surgeon, Dr. James I.
Dunn, wrote to his wife: &ldquo;At a time
when we were entirely out of dressings
of every kind, she supplied us
with everything, and while the shells
were bursting in every direction ...
she staid [<i>sic</i>] dealing out shirts ...
and preparing soup and seeing it prepared
in all the hospitals.... I
thought that night if heaven ever sent
out a homely angel, she must be one,
her assistance was so timely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dunn&rsquo;s letter was widely published
during the Civil War, and he was
embarrassed that his private portrayal
of Barton as a &ldquo;homely angel&rdquo;
ever saw print. She, too, seems to
have been embarrassed, for she
crossed the word out on the newspaper
clippings she kept and substituted
the word &ldquo;holy&rdquo; for &ldquo;homely.&rdquo; Although
the original letter shows that
Dunn did indeed mean &ldquo;homely,&rdquo;
Barton&rsquo;s biographers have taken
their cue from her and given her the
title &ldquo;the holy angel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These early battles taught Clara
Barton how poorly prepared the
Union army was for the immense
slaughter taking place and how immediate
battlefield aid meant much
more than a battalion of nurses back
in Washington.</p>
<p>In quick succession the battles of
Fairfax Court House and Chantilly
followed second Bull Run. A surgeon
recalled that at Chantilly &ldquo;we
had nothing but our instruments&mdash;not
even a bottle of wine. When the
[railroad] cars whistled up to the station,
the first person on the platform
was Miss Barton again to supply us
with ... every article that could be
thought of. She staid [<i>sic</i>] there till
the last wounded soldier was placed
on the cars.&rdquo; She worked for five
days in the pouring rain with only
two hours of sleep. As at all battles,
she took time to jot down the names
of many wounded men, so that their
families could be informed.</p>
<p>Barely two weeks later, on September
14, she again went to the
field, this time with advance information
about a battle to be fought near
Harpers Ferry, Virginia (now West
Virginia). She arrived too late but
rushed on to Antietam, which she
reached at the height of battle on
September 17. Once again, she
cooked gruel, braved enemy fire to
feed the wounded, and provided surgeons
with precious medical supplies.
She had a narrow escape from death
when a bullet passed under her arm,
through the sleeve of her dress, and
killed the wounded soldier cradled in
her arms.</p>
<p>In all this fury, Barton was unflappable.
At the Battle of Fredericksburg
in December 1862, &ldquo;a shell
destroyed the door of the room in
which she was attending to wounded
men,&rdquo; recalled co-worker Rev. C.M.
Welles. &ldquo;She did not flinch, but continued
her duties as usual.&rdquo; And she
was working at the Lacy House,
where hundreds of men were crowded
into 12 rooms, when a courier
rushed up the steps and placed a
crumpled, bloody slip of paper in
her hands. It was a request from a
surgeon asking her to cross the Rappahanock
River to Fredericksburg
where she was urgently needed. As
always, hospital space was inadequate,
and dying men, lying in the
December chill, were freezing to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
ground. With shells and bullets whistling
around her, Barton bravely
crossed the swaying pontoon bridge.
As she reached the end of the bridge
an officer stepped to her side to help
her down. &ldquo;While our hands were
raised, a piece of an exploding shell
hissed through between us, just below
our arms, carrying away a portion
of both the skirts of his coat and
my dress.&rdquo; She made her way into
Fredericksburg without further mishap.
She was lucky; the gallant officer
who helped her on the bridge
was brought to her a half hour
later&mdash;dead.</p>
<p>Bravery and timeliness were conspicuous
elements of Barton&rsquo;s Civil
War service. But of equal importance
was her compassion for the individual
soldier. And she treated the
wounded of both sides alike. Her relief
work was also notable for its resourcefulness.
She built fires, extracted
bullets with a pocket knife,
made gallons of applesauce, baked
pies &ldquo;with crinkly edges,&rdquo; drove
teams, and performed last rites.
When all other food gave out she
concocted a mixture of wine, whiskey,
sugar, and army biscuit crumbs.
&ldquo;Not very inviting,&rdquo; she admitted,
&ldquo;but always acceptable.&rdquo; When she
lacked serving implements, she emptied
jars of fruit and jelly and used
them. When tired she propped herself
against a tent pole or slept sitting
up in a wagon. The common soldier
remembered her sympathy and tenderness,
the officer her calmness and
alert activity under fire.</p>
<p>As historian R.H. Bremer notes,
Barton viewed her role in the war as
something of a family matter. If she
was a &ldquo;ministering angel,&rdquo; she was
also &ldquo;everybody&rsquo;s old-maid aunt&rdquo;&mdash;fussing
over &ldquo;my boys,&rdquo; worrying
over clothes and food, and treating
the men as fond nephews. Much of
her success with quartermasters, officers,
and men was due to this attitude,
which eclipsed suspicion of her
as a woman and radiated the sentimentality
of the time.</p>
<p>She pursued her self-appointed
task with remarkable tenacity. Her
contribution was unique, for she
worked directly on the battlefield,
not behind the lines in a hospital.
She worked primarily alone&mdash;and
liked it that way. Although she respected
such organizations as the
Sanitary Commission, she felt that by
working independently she could
comfortably assist where she saw
need. She wanted to be her own boss
and be appreciated for her individual
efforts. She did not seek glory, but
she needed praise and did not wish
to have it bestowed on the name of
an impersonal group or commission.</p>
<p>There is no question that Clara
Barton hugely enjoyed acclaim. She
liked being in the inner elite of wartime
politics, for it gave her the
chance to shine as a personality, to
be revered as an &ldquo;Angel of the Battlefield.&rdquo;
In later life she enjoyed
trips to Europe that amounted to
triumphal tours.</p>
<p>Barton&rsquo;s relief work benefitted
her in another way. Throughout
her life she was self-conscious
and introspective, preoccupied with
small personal incidents which she
magnified out of proportion to
their importance. She once described
herself as &ldquo;like other people ...
only sometimes a &lsquo;little more so,&rsquo;&rdquo;
and the description is apt. She was
inwardly pessimistic, and highly sensitive
to criticism. She confided to
her diary that she felt &ldquo;pursued by a
shadow&rdquo; and spent years with
&ldquo;scarcely one cheerful day.&rdquo; Periodically
she became so depressed that
she could not &ldquo;see much these days
worth living for; cannot but think it
will be a quiet resting place when all
these cares and vexations and anxieties
are over, and I no longer give or
take offense. I ... have grown
weary of life at an age when other
people are enjoying it most.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Clara Barton was not the only civilian who
ministered to the wounded during the Civil
War. The nature of this conflict was so personal
and so immediate that many hundreds of
volunteers gave enormously of their time in
hospitals and on the field. In the North, Dorothea
Dix interrupted her pre-war work with
the insane to become superintendent of Female
Nurses; Walt Whitman, Louisa May Alcott,
Frances Dana Gage, and &ldquo;Mother&rdquo; Mary
Ann Bickerdyke are a few of the other famous
names connected with such service. Of especial
importance were the Christian and Sanitary
Commissions, organizations which worked with
the government in camp and on the battlefield
to improve the lot of the Union soldier. In the
Confederacy, stringent financial conditions and
widely scattered population prevented relief
efforts from being as organized as those of the
North. But charity had a deep-rooted meaning
for the Southern cause, and self-denial became
a matter of pride. &ldquo;We had no Sanitary Commission
in the South,&rdquo; wrote one Confederate
veteran, &ldquo;we were too poor.... With us each
house was a hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The United States Sanitary Commission was
established in April 1861. It was originally designed
for inquiry into the health of the troops
and as an advisory board to the government
on improvement of sanitary conditions in the
army. In the early months of the war, the Sanitary
Commission attempted to methodize the
fragmented benevolent efforts of the Union. It
fought favoritism to particular regiments with
equitable distribution of supplies, administered
from a network of regional and local auxiliaries.
By 1863, however, the commission was,
of necessity, drawn to the battlefield, where it
established hospital and transport ships, supply
stations, and gave direct aid to the wounded.
Several million dollars were raised by the commission
through &ldquo;Sanitary Fairs,&rdquo; large fund-raising
bazaars. At one point the Sanitary
Commission had more than 500 agents working
in the field. By its impartiality and organization,
the Sanitary Commission was the forerunner
of the Red Cross in concept, if not in
actuality.</p>
<p>Another organization, drawn along similar
lines, was the United States Christian Commission.
Established by a group of New York
churches in 1862, its object was to &ldquo;give relief
and sympathy and then the Gospel.&rdquo; Volunteers
in the Christian Commission were called
&ldquo;Ambassadors of Jesus;&rdquo; they were chosen
largely from the ranks of clergymen and
YMCA members but many women were
among its workers. The Christian Commission
did give battlefield relief, and sought to supply
reading material, clothing, and medicine.</p>

<p>Clara Barton was familiar with these organizations,
and, especially in the latter part of the
war, often worked alongside them. But though
she wrote publicly that their labor was always
in &ldquo;perfect accord, mutual respect and friendliness,&rdquo;
she chose to work alone rather than
align herself too closely with the commissions.
Barton&rsquo;s natural leadership and difficulty in
working with others prompted her to remain
independent, where she would not be &ldquo;compromised
by them in the least.&rdquo; Furthermore,
she secretly scorned the commissions&rsquo; work,
which she thought inexperienced and impractical:
&ldquo;an old fudge&rdquo; she called the Sanitary
Commission in her journal.</p>
<p>Barton also chose not to work with Dorothea
Dix&rsquo;s &ldquo;Department of Female Nurses.&rdquo; A
compulsive humanitarian worker, Dix had volunteered
her services to the War Department
at the opening of hostilities. Her offer was accepted
and Dix began the impossible task of
collecting supplies, selecting nurses, and supervising
hospitals for the Union army. Dix was a
perfectionist and her dogmatic and strident
opinions won her few friends. But her sharp
altercations with physicians and officers resulted
more from frustration because she could
not relieve the massive misery, than from an
over-bearing personality. Feeling that she had
failed to achieve her mission, Dix wrote at
war&rsquo;s end: &ldquo;This is not the work I would have
my life judged by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The use of female nurses was an innovation
during the Civil War and Dix was anxious for
the women under her to be taken seriously.
Fearful that nursing would become a sport
among adventurous young women, she laid
down stringent and inflexible rules for nurses.
These rules would have greatly hampered
Clara Barton&rsquo;s independent spirit and this is
one reason she chose not to join Dix&rsquo;s force.</p>
<p>In addition to the official organizations there
were numerous &ldquo;unsung heroes&rdquo; during the
Civil War. Most notable were the religious
orders such as the Sisters of Charity who
calmly defied the army&rsquo;s restrictions and
worked both at the front and in hospitals. Despite
the fact that such diverse groups inevitably
caused conflicts and jealousies, the Civil
War provided a field large enough for all of
the humanitarian organizations which labored
in it.</p>

<p>While aiding others, Barton, for a
time, forgot herself. Her &ldquo;work and
words,&rdquo; she insisted, were solely
bound up in &ldquo;the individual soldier&mdash;what
he does, sees, feels, or thinks in
... long dread hours of leaden rain
and iron hail.&rdquo; As she gained self-confidence
and acclaim, she shed her
morbid introspection. Once when she
was asked if her work had been interesting,
she gave a revealing reply:
&ldquo;When you stand day and night in
the presence of hardship and physical
suffering, you do not stop to think
about the interest. There is no time
for that. Ease pain, soothe sorrow,
lessen suffering&mdash;this is your only
thought day and night. Everything,
everything else is lost sight of&mdash;yourself
and the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In April 1863, Barton transferred
her base from Washington to Hilton
Head Island off the coast of South
Carolina. She had been advised that
a major siege of Charleston would
be attempted and believed she could
be most useful there. She also hoped
to be closer to her brothers: Stephen
lived behind Confederate lines in
North Carolina, and David had been
sent by the army to Hilton Head in
the early days of 1863.</p>
<p>During the eight-month siege of
Charleston, she worked on the battlefields
of Morris Island and Fort
Wagner and helped nurse soldiers
dying of malaria and other tropical
fevers. Charleston proved to be a
less active spot than anticipated,
however, and this fact, coupled with
a growing rift between Barton and
hospital authorities, led her to leave
the area in January 1864. She returned
to Washington, where she
continued to gather supplies as she
awaited her next chance for service.</p>
<p>Her chance came in May 1864,
when &ldquo;the terrible slaughter of the
Wilderness and Spotsylvania turned
all pitying hearts once more to Fredericksburg.&rdquo;
Here she witnessed
some of the most frightening scenes
she ever encountered. Fifty thousand
men were killed or wounded in the
Wilderness Campaign. &ldquo;I saw many
things that I did not wish to see and
I pray God I may never see again,&rdquo;
she told a friend. Rain turned the
red clay soil of Virginia to deep mud,
and hundreds of army wagons,
crowded full of wounded and suffering
men, were stuck in a tremendous
traffic jam. &ldquo;No hub of a wheel was
in sight and you saw nothing of any
animal below its knees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She immediately set about feeding
the men in the stalled wagons, but
another, more appalling situation
arose. Some &ldquo;heartless, unfaithful officers&rdquo;
decided that it was, in fact, a
hardship on the refined citizens of
Fredericksburg to be compelled to
open their homes as hospitals for
&ldquo;these dirty, lousy, common
soldiers.&rdquo; Always a champion of the
&ldquo;army blue&rdquo; against the &ldquo;gold
braid,&rdquo; she hurried to Washington to
advise her friend Henry Wilson of
the predicament. Wilson, chairman
of the Senate Military Affairs Committee,
swiftly warned the War Department.
One day later the homes
of Fredericksburg were opened to
Union soldiers. She returned to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
battlefield with additional supplies
and continued to help the wounded.
&ldquo;When I rose, I wrung the blood
from the bottom of my clothing before
I could step, for the weight
about my feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the Wilderness Campaign
she served as a supervisor of nurses
for the Army of the James, under
Gen. Benjamin F. Butler, until January
1865. She organized hospitals and
nurses and administered day-to-day
activities in the invalid camps that received
the wounded from Cold Harbor,
Petersburg, and other battles
near Richmond. Many of these soldiers
remembered her thoughtfulness.
If a wounded man requested
codfish cakes &ldquo;in the old home way,&rdquo;
he most likely got them; a young soldier,
wasted to a skeleton, was tenderly
cared for until his relatives arrived
to take him home; requests to
have letters written were never too
much trouble.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig37">

<p class="pcap"><i>Throughout the Civil War Benjamin
Butler (1818-93) was a
controversial figure as he invariably
was at odds with the
national administration on the
treatment of the civilian population
and the black slaves.
Leaving the Army, he went into
politics and served in the U.S.
Congress and one term as governor
of Massachusetts. It was
as governor that he appointed
Clara Barton superintendent of
the Women&rsquo;s Reformatory at
Sherborn.</i></p>
</div>
<p>At the end of the Civil War an exhausted
Clara Barton felt certain of
one thing: &ldquo;I have labored up to the
full measure of my strength.&rdquo; And
she labored without pay and often
used her own funds to buy supplies.
In the field she shared the conditions
of the common soldier: &ldquo;I have always
refused a tent unless the army
had tents also, and I have never
eaten a mouthful ... until the sick
of the army were abundantly supplied.&rdquo;
Her pragmatic judgment and
ability to work under the most dangerous
and awkward of conditions
earned her the respect of surgeons
and generals who ordinarily considered
they had &ldquo;men enough to act as
nurses&rdquo; and did not want women
around to &ldquo;skeddadle and create a
panic.&rdquo; General Butler described her
as having &ldquo;executive ability and kindheartedness,
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
with an honest love of
the work of reformation and care of
her living fellow creatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barton&rsquo;s perceptive and sympathetic
nature led her to foresee innumerable
social problems after the
Civil War. A champion of the underdog,
she was concerned with the precarious
situation of the newly freed
slaves. What she saw on her travels
to the South was alarming: uneducated,
dependent blacks were being
duped by their former masters, and
freedom was, in many cases, a burden,
not a blessing. Few blacks knew
of the laws passed for their benefit
and many did not understand that
they must continue to work. She observed
that the former &ldquo;owners were
disposed to cheat [a] great many.&rdquo;
Wherever she went, Barton tried to
explain the law and the meaning of
freedom to the blacks, many of
whom walked great distances to ask
her advice.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Frederick Douglass (1817?-95)
was born in Talbot County,
Maryland, the son of a white
man and a slave woman. He was
an eloquent spokesman for
American blacks before and
after the Civil War and spent
his life fighting for equality. He
was appointed U.S. minister to
Haiti in 1889.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Barton, however, did more than
advise. She consulted with Senator
Wilson about the best possible personnel
for the Freedman&rsquo;s Bureau
and lobbied Congress for a bill allowing
blacks to use surplus army goods.
She attended meetings of the Freedman&rsquo;s
Aid Society and sent reports
on blacks&rsquo; conditions to the Freedman&rsquo;s
Bureau. She also worked for
the extension of suffrage through
&ldquo;Universal Franchise&rdquo; meetings and
the American Equal Rights Association;
she spoke at their rallies and
formed lifelong attachments with
such prominent leaders as Frederick
Douglass and Anna Dickenson. During
October of 1868, she began to
formulate a plan for helping &ldquo;the colored
sufferers.&rdquo; The plan, modelled
on the work of Josephine Griffing,
apparently involved the use of abandoned
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
barracks and former hospitals
near Washington for &ldquo;Industrial
Houses.&rdquo; Here Freedmen could learn
a trade and be &ldquo;provided with the
means of self-support and so command
the respect of [their] former
masters.&rdquo; She discussed her ideas
with several people, but unfortunately,
the project was dropped because
of her failing health.</p>
<p>Barton remained a staunch ally of
blacks during her lifetime. Blacks
employed by her received wages consistent
with those of whites and generally
received additional training
and education. When few other charitable
groups were willing to aid
blacks who were the victims of natural
disasters, such as the storm that
hit the Sea Islands of South Carolina
in 1893, Barton&rsquo;s Red Cross never
hesitated. And those who denied the
bravery or competence of black
troops in the Civil or Spanish-American
Wars found her an outspoken
opponent. Made honorary president
of a society honoring soldiers of the
Spanish-American War, she resigned
when she found that it was open only
to whites.</p>
<p>At the same time she was promoting
the enfranchisement of freedmen,
she embarked on a project aimed at
diminishing another major post-war
problem: the whereabouts of thousands
of missing soldiers. She appreciated
the difficulty of keeping accurate
records in the confusion of
battle and understood that it was
often nearly impossible to recognize
the dead, or identify individual
graves among the hastily dug common
trenches. Her wartime notebooks
and diaries are filled with
names of missing and wounded soldiers
and lists of those who died in
her arms with perhaps no one else to
know their fate. With official permission
from President Lincoln, she devised
a plan to identify missing soldiers
by publishing in newspapers
monthly rolls of men whose families
or friends had inquired. Any person
with information could write to her
and she would forward it to those
concerned.</p>
<p>As she went about her work she
learned that not everyone was willing
to be found. Soldiers who were attached
to Southern sweethearts, who
had deserted, or who simply wished
to start a new life, preferred to remain
missing. One young man
wanted to know what he had done to
have his name &ldquo;blazoned all over the
country&rdquo; in newspapers. &ldquo;What you
have done ... I certainly <i>do not</i>
know,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;It seems to
have been the misfortune of your
family to think more of you than you
did of them, and probably more than
you deserve from the manner in
which you treat them.... I shall inform
them of your existence lest you
should not &lsquo;see fit&rsquo; to do so
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In all, Barton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Office of Correspondence
with Friends of the Missing
Men of the United States Army&rdquo;
worked for four years to bring information
to more than 22,000 families.
The most help she received came
from a young man named Dorence
Atwater, a former Andersonville
prisoner. He fortuitously had copied
the names of more than 13,000 men
who had died during his confinement.
With his aid, she identified all
but 400 of the Andersonville graves
and caused the camp to be made a
National Cemetery.</p>
<p>Atwater&rsquo;s help was invaluable, and
he became a close personal friend.
She was highly indignant when the
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
Federal Government arrested Atwater
on charges that his death list was
government property. Federal officials
claimed that he had &ldquo;stolen&rdquo;
back the list after turning it over to
the War Department. The case appears
to have been actually based on
confusion and a stubborn refusal of
both sides to back down, but Clara
Barton was incensed. She fought for
Atwater&rsquo;s release with every influential
person she knew; she advised
and prompted his statements from
prison and carried on a monumental
publicity campaign to elicit public
sympathy. Largely because of her efforts,
he was freed.</p>
<p>Atwater&rsquo;s defense and her work
with the missing men further developed
her publicity efforts, which she
had used so effectively in the Civil
War. As time went on, her relief
work relied more and more on public
support. &ldquo;We enter a field of distress,&rdquo;
she wrote, &ldquo;study conditions,
learn its needs, and state these facts
calmly, and truthfully to the people
of the entire country through all its
channels of information and leave
them free to use their own judgments
in regard to the assistance they will
render.&rdquo; Still, she knew how to publicize
her causes dramatically. In
1886, when a tornado struck Mount
Vernon, Illinois, she wrote: &ldquo;the pitiless
snow is falling on the heads of
3,000 people who are without homes,
without food, or clothing.&rdquo; The response
was immediate.</p>
<p>Oral publicity also proved helpful
during her attempt to identify missing
men. In 1866, she began a successful
lecture tour that publicized
both her cause and her name. She
gave lectures throughout the North
and West and was featured on tours
with such prominent speakers as
Ralph Waldo Emerson, William
Lloyd Garrison, and Mark Twain.
Her talks centered on &ldquo;Work and Incidents
of Army Life.&rdquo; The flyer portrayed
her lectures as &ldquo;exquisitely
touching and deeply interesting, frequently
moving her audience to
tears.&rdquo; As always, she enjoyed the
notoriety and in her diary wrote a
flattering description of herself at the
lecturn: &ldquo;easy and graceful, neith[er]
tall nor short, neith[er] large nor
small ... head large and finely
shaped with a profusion of jet-black
hair ... with no manner of ornament
save its own glossy beauty....
She [is] <i>well</i> dressed.... Her voice
... at first low and sweet but falling
upon the ear with a clearness of tone
and distinctness of utterance at once
surprising and entrancing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although she enjoyed being in the
limelight, many of her old insecurities
returned. &ldquo;All speech-making
terrifies me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;first I have
no taste for it, lastly I hate it.&rdquo; In
1868, while delivering a lecture in
Boston, she suffered what was apparently
a nervous breakdown and was
ordered by her doctors to recuperate
in Europe.</p>
<p>The periodic nervous disorders she
suffered appear to have been directly
related to her sense of usefulness.
When she was not working, her diary
entries often begin &ldquo;Have been sad
all day,&rdquo; or &ldquo;This was one of the
most down-spirited days that ever
comes to me.&rdquo; She once remarked
that nothing made her so sick of life
as to feel she was wasting it. As long
as she was needed, admired, demanded,
she could perform near miracles
of self-denial and courageous
action. When the crisis ebbed, she
became despondent and sick, requiring
attention of a different sort. As a
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
single woman, often removed from
her family, she had no other way to
attract notice than to excel as an individual.
When such an opportunity
faded, or when she found herself an
object of criticism, she was, in several
senses, prostrated. When her interest
was again aroused by the
chance of giving service, her health
and spirits rebounded.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Jean-Henri Dunant</i></p>
</div>
<p>Clara Barton arrived in Great Britain
in late August 1869 with no definite
plans. Her doctors had ordered rest
and a change of scene. She toured
London, visited Paris, then proceeded
to Geneva. She thought she
might stay in Switzerland, but the depressing
fall weather changed her
mind; she moved to Corsica, seeking
sun and wishing to visit the haunts of
her longtime hero, Napoleon I.</p>
<p>She was ill, edgy, and demanding.
Corsica, although beautiful, did not
suit her and by March she was back
in Geneva. Here, by chance, she was
introduced to Dr. Louis Appia, a
member of the International Committee
of the Red Cross. This organization
was the result of the Geneva
Convention of 1864, which produced
a treaty dealing with the treatment of
wounded and sick soldiers, prisoners
of war, and civilians under wartime
conditions. The convention was inspired
by a book entitled <i>Un Souvenir
de Solferino</i> (A Memory of Solferino),
in which author Jean-Henri
Dunant described the horrors of the
Battle of Solferino. At the time of
her meeting with Appia, she had not
heard of the Geneva Convention
nor of Dunant. When she finally
read Dunant&rsquo;s work, she must have
identified strongly with it, for he expressed
perfectly the concern for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
individual which had prompted Barton&rsquo;s
Civil War aid: &ldquo;A son idolized
by his parents, brought up and cherished
for years by a loving mother
who trembled with alarm over his
slightest ailment; a brilliant officer
beloved by his family, with wife and
children at home; a young soldier
who had left sweetheart or mother,
sisters or old father to go to war; all
lie stretched in the mud and dust,
drenched in their own blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At their first meeting, Appia asked
Barton why the United States had
not signed the Treaty of Geneva. A
U.S. delegate, Charles Bowles, had
been at the Geneva Convention, and
Dr. Henry Bellows, president of the
Sanitary Commission, had urged the
government to accede to the treaty.
But the United States remained the
only major nation that had not accepted
the international pact. Barton
said a key factor was probably the
American public&rsquo;s almost total ignorance
about the treaty, and she asked
Appia to provide her with further information
about the International
Red Cross.</p>
<p>Barton soon found reason, in her
words, &ldquo;to respect the cause and appreciate
the work of the Geneva
Convention.&rdquo; On July 19, 1870,
France declared war on Prussia. She
was restless and excited by hearing
guns at practice and wrote to Appia,
offering her services to the Red
Cross. Before he could reply, however,
she made her way to Basel,
Switzerland, where she worked with
Red Cross volunteers making bandages.
This tame work exasperated
her. &ldquo;It is not like me, nor like my
past to be sitting quietly where I can
just watch the sky reddening with the
fires of a bombarded city and ...
have [nothing] to do with it.&rdquo; Despite
her frustration, Barton&rsquo;s work
in Basel gave her great respect for
the garnering power of the Red
Cross. Its warehouses were stocked
with supplies of all kinds, and trained
nurses and clerks wearing Red Cross
armbands stood ready to assist. &ldquo;I
... saw the work of these Red Cross
societies in the field, accomplishing
in four months under this systematic
organization what we failed to accomplish
in four years without it&mdash;no
mistakes, no needless suffering, no
starving, no lack of care, no waste,
no confusion, but order, plenty,
cleanliness, and comfort wherever
that little flag made its way, a whole
continent marshalled under the banner
of the Red Cross&mdash;as I saw all
this, and joined and worked in it,
you will not wonder that I said to
myself, &lsquo;If I live to return to my
country, I will try to make my people
understand the Red Cross and that
treaty.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The opportunity to be useful and
to forget petty irritants restored her
health. &ldquo;I am so glad to be able to
work once more,&rdquo; she told her cousin,
Elvira Stone, &ldquo;I <i>have</i> worked
... all year, and grown stronger and
better.&rdquo; She then made her way toward
the battlefields of France accompanied
by Antoinette Margot, a
young Swiss woman. On their way
toward Mulhouse, where several battles
had been reported, they met
hundreds of refugees who pleaded
with them to turn back. But when
they encountered trouble from German
troops, Barton brought out a
sewing kit and speedily tacked a
cross of red ribbon onto the sleeve of
her dress. Thus began her first service
under the Red Cross badge,
which she would wear long and
proudly.</p>

<p>Barton was disappointed to learn
that she was not needed at the front,
but she found her niche elsewhere.
As she traveled through France, she
wrote to newspaper editor Horace
Greeley that she had seen deserted
fields, &ldquo;crops spoiled ... by both
friend and foe. Her producing population
stands under arms or wasting
in prisons&mdash;her hungry cattle slain
for food or rotting of disease&mdash;her
homes deserted or smouldering in
ashes.&rdquo; When Louise, grand duchess
of Baden and a Red Cross patron,
asked her to help establish hospitals
and distribute clothing to destitute
civilians, she undertook the work
with zeal.</p>
<p>Barton&rsquo;s accomplishments during
the Franco-Prussian War lay mainly
in aid to civilians. Her most notable
work was in Strasbourg, where she
used her powers of organization and
publicity to establish a sewing center
to clothe the city&rsquo;s destitute population.
In a letter to a generous English
philanthropist in May 1871, she
wrote: &ldquo;Thousands who are well to-day
will rot with smallpox and be devoured
by body-lice before the end
of August. Against ... these two
scourges there is, I believe, no check
but the destruction of all infected
garments; hence the imperative necessity
for something to take their
place. Excuse, sir, I pray you, the
plain ugly terms which I have employed
to express myself; the facts
are plain and ugly.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<h4 class="interlude">Jean-Henri Dunant and the Geneva Convention</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>On June 24, 1859, forces commanded by
French Emperor Napoleon III and Austria&rsquo;s
Emperor Franz Josef, met on the battlefield of
Solferino, in Northern Italy. More than 40,000
men were killed or wounded in the battle, and
towns and villages throughout the area became
temporary, crude hospitals. In nearby Castiglione,
a stranger, dressed in white, watched
with horror as dazed and suffering soldiers
were slowly brought from the battlefield only
to be met with a shortage of doctors, inadequate
accommodations, and an appalling lack
of food and supplies. With spirit and speed
&ldquo;the man in white&rdquo; began to recruit local
peasants for volunteer service and to procure
badly needed bandages, water, and food.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;man in white&rdquo;&mdash;Jean-Henri Dunant&mdash;was
not new to philanthropic endeavors. Born
in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1828, he came of a
well-to-do family with a strong religious background
and a tradition of public service. As a
young man Dunant had been an instigator of
the movement that created the Young Men&rsquo;s
Christian Association (YMCA), which he
hoped would promote fellowship and understanding
between young men of many cultural
backgrounds. Until the age of 30, Dunant was
a banker, with business interests throughout
Europe and Northern Africa. In June of 1859,
these financial affairs took him to Castiglione.</p>
<p>In a sense, Dunant never completely left
Solferino. The many startling scenes he witnessed
there continued to crowd his mind.
&ldquo;What haunted me,&rdquo; wrote Dunant, &ldquo;was the
memory of the terrible condition of the thousands
of wounded.&rdquo; This horrible remembrance
of men dying, often for want of the simplest
care, inspired him to publish in 1862 a
vivid account of the battle and its consequences.
The book was called <i>Un Souvenir de
Solferino</i> (A Memory of Solferino).</p>
<p>The realistic descriptions, and the compassion
for the individual soldier shown in Dunant&rsquo;s
book created an immediate sensation in
Europe. <i>Un Souvenir de Solferino</i> wasted little
space on the traditional &ldquo;glories&rdquo; of war; Dunant
was more interested in the plight of the
&ldquo;simple troopers ... [who] suffered without
complaint ... [and] ... died humbly and quietly.&rdquo;
The book advocated a radically new
concept of charitable action: that all of the
wounded, friend and foe alike, should be
cared for. He had been inspired, said Dunant,
by the Italian peasant women who murmured
&ldquo;tutti fratelli&rdquo; (all are brothers) while treating
the hated Austrians. Near the end of the book
was a brief paragraph, destined to have dramatic
impact on the humanitarian efforts of
the world: &ldquo;Would it not be possible,&rdquo; wrote
Dunant, &ldquo;in time of peace and quiet, to form
relief societies for the purpose of having care
given to the wounded in wartime of zealous,
devoted and thoroughly qualified volunteers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The simple question may have been overlooked
by readers caught up in the battle
scenes of <i>Un Souvenir de Solferino</i>. But it
caught the imagination of one influential man:
Gustav Moynier, a citizen of Geneva who
headed the charitable &ldquo;Committee for the
Public Benefit.&rdquo; Moynier introduced a practical
direction to Dunant&rsquo;s dreams. He contacted
Dunant, and together they established a
committee, headed by Moynier, and including
the commanding general of the Swiss Army,
Guillaume Dufour. Two distinguished doctors,
Louis Appia and Theodore Maunoir, completed
the &ldquo;Committee of Five.&rdquo; This committee
immediately began plans for an international
convention to discuss the treatment of
the wounded in wartime.</p>
<p>In February 1863, 16 nations met in Geneva
to discuss &ldquo;the relief of wounded armies in the
field.&rdquo; Dunant&rsquo;s proposals were debated and
an informal list of agreements was drawn up.
This agreement established the national volunteer
agencies for relief in war. Then, in August
1864 a second conference was held which produced
the international pact, known as the
Treaty of Geneva. The treaty rendered &ldquo;neutral
and immune from injury in war the sick
and wounded and all who cared for them.&rdquo; To
distinguish the neutral medical personnel, supplies
and sick, an international badge was
needed. Out of respect for Dunant and the
country which had been host of the conventions,
the design adopted was that of the reversed
Swiss flag. Those working under the
Treaty of Geneva would thereafter be recognized
by the emblem of a red cross on a white
flag. The United States signed this treaty on
March 16, 1882.</p>
<p>Jean-Henri Dunant&rsquo;s generous dream had
been fulfilled, but he obtained no glory or recognition
for many years. Dunant had neglected
his business interests while promoting the Geneva
conventions. By 1867 he was bankrupt
and spent most of his remaining life a pauper.</p>
<p>However, Dunant did live to receive, jointly
with Frederic Passy, the first Nobel Peace
Prize in 1901. It was a fitting tribute to the
man who, in the words of Gustav Moynier,
&ldquo;opened the eyes of the blind, moved the
hearts of the indifferent, and virtually effected
in the intellectual and moral realm the reformation
to which [he] aspired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barton did not confine her activity
to Strasbourg. After eight months
work, she left her sewing establishment
in the hands of local officials
and journeyed to Paris where she
distributed clothing, money, and
comfort to citizens. From Paris she
went to Lyons and surveyed the surrounding
countryside for a relief
headquarters, finally settling in Belfort.
This small border town had
heroically withstood Prussian fire for
more than eight months. The people
were &ldquo;very poor and their ignorance
... something deplorable,&rdquo; noted
Antoinette Margot. Many of the citizens
had never seen paper money&mdash;so
Barton used only coins&mdash;and less
than one in 15 could write his name.
Her activities were still loosely tied
to the Red Cross, but in most cases
she used her own judgment to come
to terms with the destitution she
found. Money was given according to
need, solace indiscriminately. Desperate
mobs often stormed the home
of &ldquo;Monsieur l&rsquo;Administrateur&rdquo; in
which she was staying; assistant Margot
was &ldquo;amused ... to see Miss
Barton <i>protecting her policemen</i>&rdquo; and
pacifying the crowds with her dignified
bearing and calm admonition to
&ldquo;wait a little and be quiet.&rdquo; Barton
tried to help the anxious families of
prisoners who had lost their means of
support and provided some relief for
the French leaving German-occupied
Alsace. Margot later remarked that
she wished &ldquo;that her own people
could see their country-woman at
work among European poor as not
one European has done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the hostilities between
France and Prussia ended, and with
it the need for Barton&rsquo;s help, her
health again declined. Despite the
decorations of several governments,
she was despondent. Her eyes gave
out, her nerves collapsed. She had
over-taxed herself in nerve-shattering
situations, and she suffered, in part,
because she had never really learned
to care for herself. Troubled
throughout her life by insomnia, she
often worked on four or five hours
sleep. A sometimes vegetarian, she
took no pains to correctly nourish
herself; dinner was too often a large
red apple or nothing at all. It is
understandable, in the light of this
negligence and spiritual decline, that
she suffered a relapse into her old
nervous disorders.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>For a time Barton stayed in Germany.
She then traveled with friends
throughout Italy, a tour highlighted
by a visit to Mt. Vesuvius. In May
1872, she visited the Riviera and
traveled via Paris to London. Though
somewhat improved, she was still
weak, and her restlessness increased
daily. She stayed in London for more
than a year, made many friends, enjoyed
horse shows and Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s,
and took part in a congress
on prison reform. But all the time
she pondered her fate, bemoaned the
sacrifice of her time, and let small incidents
unduly rankle. For a while
she considered writing for newspapers,
but she felt too listless. Visits
from a niece, from the grand duchess
of Baden, who had become her devoted
friend, and from Antoinette
Margot could not rouse her. Finally,
on September 30, 1873, she sailed on
the <i>Parthia</i> for the United States,
still worried and uncertain about her
future. &ldquo;Have ye place, each beloved
one, a place in your prayer,&rdquo; she
plaintively asked in a poem written
aboard the <i>Parthia</i>, &ldquo;Have ye work,
my brave countrymen, work for me
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barton hoped to recover her spirits
in America. Unfortunately, only a
few months after her return, she received
word that her sister, Sally,
was critically ill. She hurried from
Washington, D.C., to Oxford, Massachusetts,
only to find that Sally&rsquo;s
death had preceded her arrival by
hours. This blow was devastating;
she collapsed utterly. A year later,
still shaky and depressed, she faced
the death of Henry Wilson, her political
ally and close friend.</p>
<p>Barton was in serious need of a
restful atmosphere. Through a young
woman in Worcester she learned of a
sanitarium at Dansville, New York,
where the patients were treated with
a popular &ldquo;water cure.&rdquo; There she
found &ldquo;congenial society, wholesome
and simple food, and an atmosphere
that believed health to be possible.&rdquo;
Her health did indeed improve at
Dansville. She eventually bought a
house there, and made the small
town her home for the next ten
years. She participated in plays, attended
and gave lectures, went on
outings with other patients, and enjoyed
her position as the town&rsquo;s most
celebrated citizen. And, after one of
her lectures, she met one of the most
influential people in her life: Julian
Hubbell, a young chemistry teacher
at Dansville Seminary. They became
friends, and when she told him of the
Treaty of Geneva and how she
hoped for its adoption in the United
States, Hubbell asked what he could
do to help. &ldquo;Get a degree in medicine,&rdquo;
she advised, and Hubbell complied.
He left his teaching position
and entered the University of Michigan
medical school in 1878.</p>
<p>Julian Hubbell remained uncompromisingly
loyal to Barton. When
the American Red Cross was established,
he became its chief field
agent. As such he participated in
more actual relief work than she did.
His skillful organization and quiet
control were directly responsible for
much of the success of the early Red
Cross. Upon her resignation, he too
gave up his career.</p>

age of 18 and five years later
from Harvard Divinity School.

and Alabama, but his career
began in earnest when he became
pastor of New York City&rsquo;s
Unitarian Church of All Souls.
Throughout his life, he was
known as an inspirer of people.</i></p>
</div>
<p>In the late 1870s, Barton began to
be active again in political affairs.
Her long interest in women&rsquo;s rights
was re-kindled, especially by Harriet
Austin, a doctor at the sanitarium.
For a time, Barton adopted the
mode of Austin&rsquo;s dress reform&mdash;loose,
corsetless garments, which included
baggy trousers. It pleased her
to &ldquo;shed flannels&rdquo; and dress &ldquo;just as
free and easy as a gentleman, with
lots of pockets, and perambulate
around to suit herself.&rdquo; In 1876 she
advocated a series of dress reform
meetings and helped Susan B. Anthony
compile biographies of noted
women. In 1878, she participated in
suffrage conventions in Washington,
D.C., and Rochester, New York.</p>
<p>As Barton&rsquo;s health improved she
also renewed her interest in establishing
the Red Cross in the United
States. She knew that her first step
was to obtain the official sanction of
the International Red Cross Committee
and spent much of 1877 and 1878
corresponding with Dr. Louis Appia
about a plan for promoting the Red
Cross. Always jealous of her position
as sole representative of the cause,
Barton was not above discrediting
both Charles Bowles and Henry Bellows,
early advocates of the Red
Cross in America. Bowles is &ldquo;utterly
unreliable ... and ... never worthy
of confidence,&rdquo; Barton wrote to Appia,
and Bellows &ldquo;wears [his title of
representative] as an easy honor, and
it never occurs to him that he is retarding
the progress of the world.&rdquo;
Neither allegation was true. But Barton
gained the official blessing of the
international committee, and as their
representative began her crusade for
ratification of the Treaty of Geneva.</p>
<p>Her first concern was to educate
the public, for she had found that
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
&ldquo;the knowledge of [the] society and
its great objects in this country ... is
almost unknown, and the Red Cross
in America is a mystery.&rdquo; In 1878,
she published a small pamphlet entitled
&ldquo;What the Red Cross Is.&rdquo; She
realized that the American public did
not expect to be engaged in another
war and emphasized peacetime uses
of the Red Cross. Red Cross action
against natural disasters had actually
been proposed by Henri Dunant in
the third edition of <i>Un Souvenir de
Solferino</i>, but in her pamphlet she
gave it priority. &ldquo;To afford ready
succor and assistance in time of national
or widespread calamities, to
gather and dispense the profuse liberality
of our people, without waste
of time or material, requires the wisdom
that comes of experience and
permanent organization.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Frances Dana Gage (1808-84)
found time while raising eight
children to write and speak on
temperance, slavery, and
women&rsquo;s rights. Her anti-slavery
activities in Missouri
met with a hostile reception.
During the Civil War she helped
former slaves adjust to freedom.
In her later years she wrote
children&rsquo;s stories.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Barton also began mentioning the
Treaty of Geneva in occasional lectures
to veterans and local citizens.
She wrote persuasively to influential
friends, such as Benjamin F. Butler,
and former minister to France Elihu
B. Washburne. &ldquo;I am not only a patriotic
but a proud woman,&rdquo; she told
Washburne, &ldquo;and our position on
this matter is a subject of mortification
to me. I am humbled to see the
United States stand with the barbarous
nations of the world, outside the
pale of civilization.&rdquo; Other friends,
among them Frances Dana Gage and
Mrs. Hannah Shepard, wrote articles
advocating establishment of the Red
Cross. Barton labored many hours to
translate, write, and explain materials
on the Red Cross to influential
men in New York and Washington.</p>
<p>The same year, 1878, she presented
information concerning the
Red Cross to President Rutherford
B. Hayes. She also delivered an invitation
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
to the United States from International
Red Cross president Gustav
Moynier to join the association.
But she found little enthusiasm in the
Hayes administration. A fear of &ldquo;entangling
alliances&rdquo; with other countries
still prevailed and the State Department
shied away from permanent
treaties. Furthermore, the treaty had
previously been submitted by Dr.
Bellows, and the Grant Administration
had rejected it. Hayes considered
the subject closed.</p>
<p>When a Congressional joint resolution
to ratify the Treaty of Geneva
was tabled early in 1879, she shelved
her own plans for a while, traveled
between New York State and Washington,
D.C., lectured some, and entertained
relatives at her Dansville
home. But she remained alert for an
opportunity, and when James A.
Garfield ran for President in 1880,
she campaigned in his behalf. With
his election that November, she
hoped for a more sympathetic administration.
To her relief, she found
both Garfield and Secretary of State
James Blaine interested. Plans were
made to submit the treaty to the Senate
for ratification, and she continued
to lobby senators.</p>
<p>In June 1881, with success in sight,
Barton and a few friends formed the
first American Association of the
Red Cross. She was elected president,
an office she originally planned
to keep only until the Treaty of Geneva
was signed. The organization&rsquo;s
main purpose at this stage was to
promote adoption of the treaty, without
which the body had no international
authority or recognition. The
first local chapter of the American
Red Cross, and the first to give actual
aid, was established at Dansville,
New York, in August 1881.</p>
<p>Even with the organization established,
Barton&rsquo;s trials were not over.
The assassination of President Garfield
in the summer of 1881 deterred
the process of ratification by several
months. She also was concerned
about the many rival organizations
that were mushrooming around her.
The &ldquo;Red Star,&rdquo; &ldquo;Red Crescent,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;White Cross&rdquo; all appeared.
One group, the &ldquo;Blue Anchor,&rdquo;
posed a threat to the treaty ratification,
for several senators&rsquo; wives belonged
to it and were openly hostile
to her. The rival charities irritated
her, and she let herself indulge in
self-pity and undue alarm. &ldquo;There is
in all the world, not one person who
will come and work beside me to establish
the justice of a good cause,&rdquo;
she wrote. &ldquo;It is only natural that I
should long to be out of the human
surroundings which care so little for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barton need not have worried so
much. The new President, Chester
A. Arthur, was an advocate of the
Red Cross, and when she called
upon the Secretary of State early in
1882 he showed her the treaty, already
printed, awaiting only the recommendations
of the Senate and official
signatures. As she read it,
Barton began to weep, for, as a cousin
remarked, &ldquo;her life and hope
were bound up in it.&rdquo; On March 16,
1882, she received a note from Senator
Elbridge Lapham informing her
of &ldquo;the ratification by the Senate of
the Geneva Convention; of the full
assent of the United States to the
same.&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Laus Deo</i>,&rdquo; concluded the
note, but to Barton it was almost anticlimactic.
&ldquo;I had waited so long,&rdquo;
she wrote in her journal, &ldquo;and was
so weak and broken, I could not
even feel glad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Clara Barton&rsquo;s success in securing
ratification of the Treaty of Geneva
is perhaps her most outstanding
achievement. Primarily through her
writing, speeches, and dedication the
public and U.S. officials came to
know of the Red Cross. For six years
she persisted in lobbying Congress;
the treaty ultimately passed without a
dissenting vote. And, although she
&ldquo;could not believe that someone
would not rise up&rdquo; to help her, no
one ever did. The American National
Red Cross remains a monument to
Barton&rsquo;s singular perseverance and
her powers of persuasion.</p>
<h3 id="c8">Barton and the Red Cross in Action</h3>
<p>Clara Barton was 60 years old when
the Treaty of Geneva was ratified by
the Senate. She at first considered
her work completed. But the immediate
demands made on the young
American Red Cross changed her
mind; she felt it would be foolish to
put the Red Cross into other hands.</p>
<p>Barton stamped the early Red
Cross decisively with her personality.
She was a woman of strong will and
deliberate action, with, as biographer
Percy Epler states, &ldquo;a just and accurate
estimate of her own power to
master a situation.&rdquo; By the 1880s,
she was accustomed to being in command.
She could, and did, inspire
great loyalty&mdash;Antoinette Margot&rsquo;s
letters to her customarily begin &ldquo;My
own so precious, so precious Miss
Barton,&rdquo; or &ldquo;So dear, so preciously
loved Miss Barton&rdquo;&mdash;though some
complained that she demanded,
rather than deserved the fealty. Barton
left no doubt that she alone governed
the Red Cross and that all
others were subordinate. One of her
most loyal aides referred to her as
&ldquo;the Queen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig47">
<img src="images/img021.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="505" />
<p class="pcap"><i>When many people are closing
out their careers, Clara Barton
was just beginning her most
important work.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>She had a sharp intellect, was able
to see issues clearly, and was articulate.
Although she had clear-cut
opinions on nearly every subject, she
was loath to force her ideas on
others. Dr. Hubbell, writing after her
death, maintained that she disliked
controversy and would almost never
argue, &ldquo;but when she did speak she
could tell more facts to the point ...
with no possibility of misunderstanding
than any person I have ever
known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was confident when she was in
control of a situation, but she had
difficulty working with others. She
was a perfectionist. Determined always
to do things in her own way,
she early decided &ldquo;that I must attend
to all business myself ... and learn
to do <i>all</i> myself.&rdquo; Secretaries and
servants came and went, but few
ever satisfied her exacting demands.
In her own endeavors she could tolerate
no rival, but she did not aspire
to widespread power.</p>
<p>Privately Barton was often very
different from her public image. Criticism
was taken with apparent calm
and stoicism, but inwardly she
burned and fought the temptation
&ldquo;to go from all the world. I think it
will come to that someday,&rdquo; she
sadly noted, &ldquo;it is a struggle for me
to keep in society at all. I want to
leave all.&rdquo; Her temper was also controlled
and betrayed itself only by a
deepening of her voice and a sharpness
in her eyes. She was socially insecure
and given to self-dramatization.
She often exaggerated her
hardships to elicit pity or respect.
For example, she frequently spoke of
sitting up all night on trains as both a
measure of economy and a guard
against unnecessary personal luxury,
yet her diaries contain numerous references
to comfortable berths. Several
times she wrote flattering articles
about herself, in the third
person, which she submitted to various
periodicals. In one, written during
the Franco-Prussian War, she
showed the way she hoped the public
would view her: &ldquo;Miss Clara Barton,
scarcely recovered from the fatigues
and indispositions resulting from her
arduous and useful duties during the
War of the Rebellion, was found
again foremost bestowing her care
upon the wounded with the same assiduity
which characterized her
among the suffering armies of her
own country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her depression and insecurity
were, in most cases, undetectable to
others. What they noticed were her
humanitarian feelings and deep and
abiding empathy for those who suffered.
Her friend, the Grand Duchess
Louise, thought of her as &ldquo;one of
those very few persons whose whole
being is goodness itself.&rdquo; Biographer
and cousin William E. Barton recalled
that she &ldquo;did not merely sympathize
with suffering; she suffered.&rdquo;
Others were struck by her witty and
spontaneous sense of humor. She
told one friend that she was more
thankful for her sense of humor than
for any other quality she possessed,
for it had helped her over hard
times.</p>
<p>Another of Barton&rsquo;s assets was a
keen spirit of objectivity. William
Barton noted that she rarely stood
on precedent and that she tried to
keep an open mind about people,
methods of business, and herself.
This openness is perceptible in her
acceptance of startling changes. Railway
travel, typewriters, automobiles,
and airplanes were all taken in
stride, and when telephones and
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
electric lights became available she
had them installed in her home immediately.
She welcomed dress reform,
prison reform, and other social
change. Clara Barton was a determined,
sensitive, competent, difficult,
and unpredictable woman, and
she brought all of these qualities to,
and etched them on, the American
Red Cross in 1882.</p>
<p>During the years that she was president
of the American Red Cross, it
was a small but well-known group.
Her name lent power and respectability
to the Red Cross cause. The
list of relief efforts undertaken in
those early years is impressive&mdash;assistance
at the sites of numerous natural
disasters, foreign aid to both
Russia and Turkey, battlefield relief
in the Spanish-American War. She
participated in nearly all of the field
work, which was her m&eacute;tier, for it
combined her humanitarian sentiments
with her need to lose herself
in her work and the remuneration of
praise.</p>
<p>The first work undertaken by the
Red Cross in America was actually
done prior to the ratification of the
Treaty of Geneva. In the fall of
1881, disastrous forest fires swept
across Michigan. Local Red Cross
chapters at Dansville and Rochester,
New York, sent money and materials
amounting to $80,000, and Barton directed
Julian Hubbell to oversee the
work. Thus did Hubbell, still a medical
student at the University of Michigan,
begin his career as chief field
agent for the American Red Cross.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig48">
<img src="images/img022.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="636" />
<p class="pcap"><i>In early September 1881,
Michigan farmers in &ldquo;the
Thumb&rdquo; of the State were
burning stubble left after the
harvest. Aggravated by drought
conditions, the fires spread to
the dry forests. One estimate
at the time stated that an area
100 by 30 kilometers (60 by 20
miles) was burned.</i></p>
</div>
<p>From 1881 on, nearly every year
saw the Red Cross actively engaged
in the relief of some calamity. In
1882, and again in 1884, the Mississippi
and Ohio Rivers flooded,
sweeping away valuable property,
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
leaving hundreds destitute and homeless.
Relief centers were established
in Cincinnati and Evansville, Indiana,
and the Red Cross steamers, the
<i>Josh V. Throop</i> and <i>Mattie Belle</i>, cooperated
with government relief
boats to supply sufferers cut off by
water. All along the rivers, families
were furnished with fuel, clothing
and food, or cash. The Red Cross
also undertook to relieve starving
and sick animals by contributing
oats, hay, corn, and medicine. Lumber,
tools, and seeds were left to
help the stricken rebuild their lives.
Barton herself supervised the work
on the <i>Mattie Belle</i> as it plowed its
way between the cities of St. Louis
and New Orleans.</p>
<p>The American Red Cross did not
attempt to supply every need in
every instance, nor did it try to aid
the victims of every calamity. A
notable case in which the Red Cross
declined to give aid occurred in 1887.
A severe drought had plagued the
people of northwestern Texas for
several years; State and Federal aid
had been denied and in desperation a
representative of the stricken area
applied to Barton for relief. She
went directly to the scene, but she
determined that what was needed
was not Red Cross aid but an organized
drive for public contributions.
Through the <i>Dallas News</i> she advertised
for help and was delighted to
find a quick response.</p>
<p>Besides flood and fire relief, the
young American Red Cross helped
tornado victims in Louisiana and
Alabama in 1883 and contributed in
the relief of an earthquake at
Charleston, South Carolina, in 1886.
When a tornado struck Mount Vernon,
Illinois, in February 1888, Barton
and her co-workers organized the
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
inhabitants so effectively that they
needed to stay at the scene only two
weeks.</p>
<p>An outbreak of yellow fever in
Jacksonville, Florida, also in 1888,
precipitated the first use of trained
Red Cross nurses, many of whom
worked heroically. In one instance,
ten of them jumped from a moving
train to enter the small town of
Macclenny, Florida, whose rail service
had been stopped because of the
fever&rsquo;s epidemic proportions. But unfortunately
the Jacksonville episode
was not an entirely happy one. Barton
had a lifelong inability to pick
qualified subordinates; in this case
the man she chose to supervise the
nurses&mdash;a Colonel Southmayd of the
New Orleans Red Cross&mdash;had extremely
poor judgment. Southmayd
found the Jacksonville workers to be
&ldquo;earnest and warm-hearted,&rdquo; but all
evidence is to the contrary. Some
nurses refused to work for three dollars
a day when they could get four
dollars in private hospitals. One got
drunk on the whiskey used as medicine,
another was arrested for theft,
and several were accused of immoral
conduct. Southmayd staunchly refused
to remove the offending
nurses, and for a time the incident
put an unfortunate stigma on Red
Cross workers. It also served to
strengthen Clara Barton&rsquo;s determination
to oversee personally as much
Red Cross field work as possible.</p>
<p>The most celebrated peacetime relief
work undertaken by the young
American Red Cross was at Johnstown,
Pennsylvania, in 1889. Johnstown,
at the point where Stony
Creek joins the Conemaugh River,
often endured spring floods, but in
May 1889 the rains were unusually
heavy. After several days low-lying
parts of Johnstown lay under 1 to 4
meters (3 to 13 feet) of water. Then
a dam broke in the mountains 16
kilometers (10 miles) from the city.
A wall of water, 9 meters (30 feet)
high, rushed down to kill 2,200 people
and destroy millions of dollars in
property.</p>
<p>Barton arrived in Johnstown five
days after the tragedy on the first
train that got through. She immediately
began work, using a tent as living
and office space, and a dry goods
box as a desk. From that desk she
administered a program that
amounted to half a million dollars,
conducted a publicity campaign, and
joined forces with the other charitable
societies working in Johnstown.
One of her aides recalled the long
hours and complex work that characterized
their five months in Johnstown
and noted that through it all
she remained &ldquo;calm, benign, tireless
and devoted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barton&rsquo;s first concern was a warehouse
for Red Cross supplies and
under her direction workmen erected
one in four days. She then turned to
alleviating the acute housing shortage.
Hotels, two stories high and
containing more than 30 rooms each,
were built and fully furnished to
serve as temporary shelters. Crews of
men were organized to clean up the
wreckage, while women volunteered
to oversee the distribution of clothing
and other necessities. As in all its
work, the Red Cross tried to supply
jobs and a spirit of self-help along
with material assistance.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Clara Barton&rsquo;s organization was
only one of many that came to the
aid of Johnstown, but its contribution
was outstanding for its quick thinking
and tireless energy. Gov. James A.
Beaver of Pennsylvania noted in a
letter of appreciation to the Red
Cross that &ldquo;she was among the first
to arrive on the scene of calamity....
She was also the last of the ministering
spirits to leave the scene of
her labors.&rdquo; The city of Johnstown
scarcely knew how to express its
thanks. &ldquo;We cannot thank Miss Barton
in words,&rdquo; an editorial in the
<i>Johnstown Daily Tribune</i> stated.
&ldquo;Hunt the dictionaries of all languages
through and you will not find
the signs to express our appreciation
of her and her work. Try to describe
the sunshine. Try to describe the
starlight. Words fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Field work took up a large portion
of Barton&rsquo;s time in the 1880s, but she
was able to pursue some other interests
and obligations. During 1883, for
example, she was superintendent of
the Women&rsquo;s Reformatory Prison at
Sherborn, Massachusetts. She undertook
the position at the request of
former general, now Gov. Benjamin
F. Butler, but she took it reluctantly.
Her administration was characterized
by the extension of dignity and education
to inmates, rather than punishment.
She found the work annoying
and depressing, and she was glad
to leave it and get back to the Red
Cross.</p>
<p>Between the burdensome paper
work and correspondence of the Red
Cross and actual relief work, Barton
found time to be the official American
representative to four International
Red Cross conferences between
1882 and 1902. She enjoyed
these trips to Europe, for they gave
her a chance to see friends and to be
honored, as she always was by court
and convention. The international
congress of 1884, at Geneva, was especially
memorable. An &ldquo;American
Amendment&rdquo; to the Geneva Treaty
was adopted, and, as the head of the
newest signatory power in the Red
Cross she was the center of attention.
The amendment sanctioned
Red Cross work in peacetime calamities
and was the direct result of her
activities in the United States. The
congress cheered as she was praised
as having &ldquo;the skill of a statesman,
the heart of a woman, and the &lsquo;final
perserverance [<i>sic</i>] of the saints.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barton was also concerned with
planning a national headquarters for
the American Red Cross. In the
1880s and early 1890s Red Cross
headquarters were located at various
spots in Washington, D.C. After
1891, however, plans were made to
build a permanent home for the organization.
Situated at Glen Echo,
Maryland, a short distance outside
Washington, the new building served
both as office and home for Barton
and her staff.</p>
<p>What few hours she could spare
from Red Cross activities she devoted
to raising the status of women.
She was proud that the Red Cross
embodied many of her beliefs. In the
last two decades of the 19th century,
she continued to speak at rallies and
join conventions promoting women&rsquo;s
rights. Her lecture topics generally
centered on philanthropic work done
by women, but she spoke out most
vehemently on female suffrage. She
was incensed that the decision to let
women vote hinged upon the assent
of male legislators, but she remained
optimistic about the ultimate outcome.
She told one lecture audience
that &ldquo;there is no one to give woman
the right to govern herself. But in
one way or another, sooner or later,
she is coming to it. And the number
of thoughtful and right-minded men
who will oppose will be much smaller
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
than we think, and when it is really
an accomplished fact, all women will
wonder, as I have done, what the objection
ever was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barton&rsquo;s prestige lent respect to
the feminist cause, and she was in
much demand as a lecturer and author.
In 1888 alone, she spoke in
Montclair, New Jersey; Dansville,
New York; Boston and Dorchester,
Massachusetts, and was a vice president
and featured speaker at the
First International Woman&rsquo;s Suffrage
Conference in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Red Cross activities in the 1890s
followed much the same pattern as
those of the previous decade. Hubbell
and Barton oversaw relief to tornado
victims in Pomeroy, Iowa, in
1893, and helped those ravaged by a
hurricane off the coast of South Carolina
in late 1893 and 1894. When
news of a famine in Russia reached
the United States, the American Red
Cross obtained supplies, including
500 carloads of corn given by Iowa
farmers, and shipped them to Russia.
The actual relief was relatively little,
but it pioneered the concept of
peacetime foreign aid.</p>

<p>American money and supplies also
were used to help victims of religious
wars in Turkey and Armenia during
1896. Although Turkey had signed
the Treaty of Geneva, Red Cross efforts
were at first resisted there.
Under strong pressure from the
American public, however, Barton
and field workers of the American
Red Cross sailed for Turkey. They
gained admittance to the country and
spent ten months helping the
wounded and distributing tools and
medical supplies. It was, in many
ways, a harrowing experience, and
the safety of the Americans was repeatedly
threatened. At least one of
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
Barton&rsquo;s biographers, Blanche Colton
Williams, thought that the Armenian
relief work was the height of
Barton&rsquo;s achievement.</p>
<p>Despite all of Clara Barton&rsquo;s
peacetime achievements, the Red
Cross remained officially connected
with the military, its chief function
being to give medical aid in time of
war. The Spanish-American War in
1898 provided the first chance for the
American Red Cross to serve in this
official capacity. Unfortunately, the
Red Cross effort was fragmented,
marked by contention and controversy,
and it ultimately led to the entire
reorganization of the Red Cross
in America.</p>
<p>The Red Cross, under Barton, sent
various types of assistance to Cuba.
The earliest efforts, starting in January
1898, were in behalf of the thousands
of Cuban nationalists who had
been herded into concentration
camps by the Spanish colonial government.
Barton was giving civilian
aid in Cuba when the battleship USS
<i>Maine</i> blew up. When war was declared
on April 25, 1898, Barton and
her small crew went to work in field
hospitals and hospital boats. She was
distressed to find that once again the
Army Medical Department had sent
inadequate personnel, and that cots,
food, and bandages were all lacking.
&ldquo;It is the Civil War all over,&rdquo; she lamented,
&ldquo;no improvement in a third
of a century.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile a controversy of distressing
proportions had developed
within the Red Cross. A powerful
local auxiliary of the American Red
Cross, in New York, felt that the
handful of workers led by 77-year-old
Barton was not adequate to meet the
needs of troops and civilians. This
chapter, which became known as the
Red Cross Relief Committee of New
York, was, in many ways, more powerful
than Barton&rsquo;s small national organization.
Where Barton&rsquo;s group
had concentrated on &ldquo;hand to
mouth&rdquo; relief efforts&mdash;those in which
funds and supplies were given as
soon as received&mdash;the New York organization
had gathered stores and
funds, and had established a hospital
and school for nurses, and formed
nearly 200 relief auxiliaries. It collected
and shipped many more articles
to Cuba during 1898 than did the
national society and sent several
times the number of trained nurses
and doctors. The Red Cross Relief
Committee of New York was professionally
run and its leaders were distressed
by Barton&rsquo;s lowscale personal
style, which had changed little since
the Civil War.</p>
<p>As she tried to retain control of
the relief efforts, the New York
group fought for government sanction
as the sole agency of the Red
Cross working in Cuba. Surgeon
General George Sternberg favored
the New Yorkers, but the secretary
of state upheld Barton&rsquo;s claim. Little
was resolved and the two organizations
continued to work independently.
When the New York Committee
requested an accounting of
funds spent in Cuba, of which it had
supplied the bulk, Barton wired to a
subordinate: &ldquo;If insisted on refuse
co-operation with [New York] committee.&rdquo;
Rivalry and jealousy took
the place of collaboration.</p>

<h4 class="interlude">Scenes from the Spanish-American War</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The Spanish-American War took place between
April 25, 1898, and August 13, 1898.
Battles were fought in the Philippines and
Puerto Rico, but most of the fighting was in
Cuba. Public reaction to the oppressive Spanish
rule of Cuba initiated the conflict, when
the battleship USS <i>Maine</i> exploded in February
1898. Although it was never proven, the
widespread belief was that the ship had been
torpedoed by the Spaniards. Clara Barton visited
the <i>Maine</i> a few days before the disaster,
and was nearby when the explosion occurred:
&ldquo;The heavy clerical work of that fifteenth day
of February held [us] ... busy at our writing
tables until late at night. The house had grown
still; the noises on the streets were dying away,
when suddenly the table shook from under our
hands, the great glass door opening on to the
... sea flew open; everything in the room was
in motion or out of place, the deafening roar
of such a burst of thunder as perhaps one
never heard before, and off to the right, out
over the bay, the air was filled with a blaze of
light, and this in turn filled with black specks
like huge specters flying in all directions. A
few hours later came ... news of the <i>Maine</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We proceeded to the Spanish hospital San
Ambrosia, to find thirty to forty wounded&mdash;bruised,
cut, burned; they had been crushed
by timbers, cut by iron, scorched by fire, and
blown sometimes high in the air, sometimes
driven down through the red-hot furnace room
and out into the water, senseless, to be picked
up by some boat and gotten ashore.... Both
men and officers are very reticent in regard to
the cause, but all declare it could not have
been the result of an internal explosion....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The earliest efforts of the Red Cross in
Cuba were to aid the civilian <i>reconcentrados</i>
who were being detained by the Spaniards.
Medical aid, clothing, and food were distributed,
and hospitals and orphanages established.
When fighting broke out, however, the
Red Cross moved to supply the needs of the
wounded. Clara Barton described the scene of
one hospital camp in July 1898: &ldquo;[We] reached
here [General William Shafter&rsquo;s headquarters]
yesterday. Five more of us came today by
army wagon and on foot. Eight hundred
wounded have reached this hospital from front
since Sunday morning. Surgeons and little
squads have worked day and night. Hospital
accommodations inadequate and many
wounded on water-soaked ground without
shelter or blankets. Our supplies a godsend.
Have made barrels of gruel and malted milk
and given food to many soldiers who have had
none in three days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barton, as always, pursued her work with
impartiality: Cubans, Spaniards, and Americans
all received her care. Henry Lathrop, a
doctor who worked for the Red Cross Committee
of New York felt this had a direct
bearing on the outcome of the war. &ldquo;Miss Barton
was everywhere among the Spanish soldiers,
sick, wounded and well. She was blessed
by the enemies of her country and I seriously
doubt if [General] Shafter himself did more to
conquer Santiago with his men, muskets and
cannon, than this woman.... The wounded
men told their comrades about the kind treatment
they had received at the hands of the
Americans, and the news spread through the
Army like wild-fire, completely changing the
conditions. Those that preferred death to surrender
were now anxious to surrender.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite such words of praise, Barton encountered
some of the same prejudices that
had hindered her work during the Civil War.
Lucy Graves, Barton&rsquo;s secretary, recorded that
&ldquo;some of the surgeons called on us; all seemed
interested in the Red Cross, but none thought
that a woman nurse would be in place in a soldier&rsquo;s
hospital. Indeed, very much out of place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most of the doctors changed their tune and
were very happy to receive Barton&rsquo;s help and
supplies during a battle. Another grateful recipient
of Red Cross supplies was Col. Theodore
Roosevelt, commander of the celebrated
&ldquo;Rough Riders.&rdquo; One day Roosevelt showed
up at Red Cross headquarters requesting food
and supplies for his sick men. &ldquo;Can I buy
them from the Red Cross?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for a million dollars,&rdquo; Barton said.</p>
<p>The colonel looked disappointed. He was
proud of his men, and said they needed these
things. &ldquo;How can I get them?&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;I
must have proper food for my sick men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just ask for them, colonel,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I do ask for them,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we had recovered from our surprise,&rdquo;
related Barton, &ldquo;the incident was
closed by the future President of the United
States slinging the big sack over his shoulders,
striding off ... through the jungle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Probably no thrill in Barton&rsquo;s life was
greater than the honor accorded her after the
fall of Santiago, Cuba. When this city was conquered,
the first vessel to enter the harbor was
the Red Cross relief ship <i>The State of Texas</i>. A
proud Barton stood on the deck of the ship
and led the little band of Red Cross workers in
singing the Doxology and &ldquo;America.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="interlude">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Barton viewed the New Yorkers as
insurgents trying to usurp her glory.
&ldquo;The world in general is after me in
many ways,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;I only wish
I could draw out of it <i>all</i>.&rdquo; She believed
that the New Yorkers&rsquo; function
should have been one of supply
and support for her own group, and
she could not understand why they
criticized her for rushing off to give
relief rather than staying at home to
direct the organization. And she did
not appreciate the problems that her
absence from Washington caused.
The Army, irritated by the internal
strife in the Red Cross, supported
neither group and offered little cooperation.
Thus, the relief effort in
Cuba ended with minimal relief given
and a divided American Red Cross.</p>
<h3 id="c9">Storm and Controversy</h3>
<p>To many members of the American
Red Cross the work in the Spanish-American
War exemplified all that
was wrong with their organization:
lack of coordination, and the arbitrary
and short-sighted rule of Clara
Barton. Yet she seemed perfectly
satisfied. In her book, <i>The Red Cross
in Peace and War</i> (1898), she contended
that the Red Cross took a
major and laudatory part in the hospital
operations in Cuba. She made
no attempts at conciliation or compromise
with her critics and continued
to run the American Red Cross
in the same individualistic style.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig51">
<img src="images/img025.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="502" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Clara Barton insisted that
assistance and relief during
peacetime become a standard
Red Cross practice. Here the
Red Cross gives help after the
hurricane at Galveston, Texas,
in 1900.</i></p>
</div>
<p>It came as no surprise to those
who knew Barton when she rushed
once more to a scene of a disaster.
In September 1900 a hurricane and
tidal wave nearly submerged Galveston,
Texas, and Barton, though 80
years old, did not hesitate. Six weeks
later she returned to Glen Echo
laden with praise and testimonials
that her achievements in Galveston
were &ldquo;greater than the conquests of
nations or the inventions of genius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her desire to remain in the field
stymied the growth of the American
Red Cross because she failed to delegate
authority. When she spent six
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
weeks or ten months away from
Washington she left behind no organization
to continue day-to-day activities,
solicit contributions, or expand
programs. Local chapters felt alienated
from the national group and resented
that they often provided the
material support but saw little of the
praise. One critic, Sophia Welk
Royce Williams, wrote: &ldquo;The National
Red Cross Association in this
country has been Miss Clara Barton,
and Miss Clara Barton has been the
National Red Cross Society....
[The Red Cross] has been of great
service to suffering humanity, but
when one asks for detailed reports,
for itemized statements of disbursements
... these things either do not
exist or are not furnished.&rdquo; The better
course, Williams believed, would
have been for the Red Cross to
adopt the organization of the Sanitary
Commission. Barton&rsquo;s group
clearly lacked a national organization,
a national board, and reports
that would stand as models and
guides for relief work.</p>
<p>If the organization suffered, the
quality of relief did not. At least one
initially skeptical correspondent saw
much to praise in the one-woman
show. While visiting the hurricane-devastated
Sea Islands in South Carolina,
Joel Chandler Harris wrote
that the Red Cross&rsquo;s &ldquo;strongest and
most admirable feature is extreme
simplicity. The perfection of its machinery
is shown by the apparent absence
of all machinery. There are no
exhibitions of self-importance. There
is no display&mdash;no tortuous cross-examination
of applicants&mdash;no needless
delay. And yet nothing is done
blindly, or hastily or indifferently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What Harris also saw was a concerted
effort to assist without the demeaning
effects of charity. Barton
developed a knack for leaving a disaster
area at the right time: &ldquo;It is indispensable
that one know when to
end such relief, in order to avoid first
the weakening of effort and powers
for self-sustenance; second the encouragement
of a tendency to beggary
and pauperism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During her 23-year tenure as president
of the American Red Cross,
Clara Barton was both its chief asset
and its greatest liability. As founder
and president she promoted the Red
Cross cause with all of her considerable
talent, and she brought zeal and
idealism to Red Cross relief work.</p>
<p>At the same time, her domineering,
and sometimes high-handed, ways
hindered organizational growth. As
Red Cross historian Foster Rhea
Dulles notes, her methods of administration
were not always based on
sound business practices and did not
command the confidence of many
people who might have given the association
broader support.</p>
<p>Barton&rsquo;s failure to delegate authority
and to acknowledge popular contributions
more formally provided
the basis for the criticism that overwhelmed
her between 1900 and 1904.
It also accounted, at least in part, for
the bitter personal attacks that led to
a deepening feud between her friends
and foes. Despite her adaptability in
earlier days, it was almost impossible
for her to adjust to the new conditions
of Red Cross activity.</p>
<p>The group that opposed her was
made up of prominent Red Cross
workers and was led by Mabel
Boardman, an able and ambitious society
woman. Boardman&rsquo;s group was
anxious to see the Red Cross reorganized
and their cause gained momentum
during 1900 and 1901. Barton
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
refused to consider it. Instead she divided
the Red Cross into camps of
&ldquo;friends&rdquo; and &ldquo;enemies.&rdquo; She accused
her foes of seeking power and
of trying to gain admission to the
royal courts of Europe through the
Red Cross. At the annual meeting in
1902 after anticipating a move to
force her resignation, she rallied her
forces and emerged with greater
powers and the presidency for life.
&ldquo;Perhaps not quite wise,&rdquo; she wrote,
&ldquo;in view of ugly remarks that may be
made.&rdquo; For the opposition, who believed
that the new charter had been
railroaded through, this was the last
straw.</p>
<p>After the 1902 meeting Barton
thought that &ldquo;the clouds of despair
and dread&rdquo; had finally lifted, but
events moved swiftly against her.
Boardman&rsquo;s group succeeded in convincing
President Theodore Roosevelt
that she was mishandling what
was, by then, a quasi-governmental
office. On January 2, 1903, his secretary
wrote to Barton stating that the
President and Cabinet would not
serve&mdash;as all of his predecessors
had&mdash;on a committee of consultation
for the Red Cross. The President directed
his secretary to announce publicly
his withdrawal from the Red
Cross board.</p>
<p>Barton was humiliated by the President&rsquo;s
clear endorsement of the opposition
faction, but she was absolutely
devastated by the subsequent
decision to have a government committee
investigate the Red Cross.
The official charges maintained that
proper books of accounts were not
kept, that funds and contributions
were not always reported to the Red
Cross treasurer, and that money was
distributed in an arbitrary and inconsistent
manner. There was also a
question about a tract of land located
in Indiana that had been donated to
the Red Cross but never reported to
the organizational board. The
charges were serious. Barton knew
that she had often used only her own
judgment to apportion relief funds
and that she seldom kept accurate
records in the field. She was so much
a part of her organization that she
often failed to differentiate between
personal and Red Cross expenses&mdash;using
her own funds for relief work
and donations for private needs. Unofficially
her foes also contended that
she was too old and infirm to lead
the Red Cross; they felt new blood
was desperately needed.</p>
<p>Barton was deeply wounded by the
controversy swirling around her. A
loyal and patriotic woman, she felt
that her friends and country had deserted
her and that she had been
scrupulously honest. For a time, she
even considered fleeing to Mexico,
but she was dissuaded by friends.
Though the investigating committee
dropped the charges, thereby completely
exonerating her from any
wrongdoing, she felt the indignity for
the rest of her life.</p>
<p>It is ironic that the qualities Clara
Barton cherished and exemplified
most&mdash;loyalty and friendship, honesty
and individual action&mdash;were the
very ones in question during the investigation.
She could not admit defeat,
or even unconscious wrongdoing
of any kind. There is no question
that the time had come for her to
give up leadership of the Red Cross,
but it is sad that her foes could not
have eased her out more gracefully
or handled the situation with tact and
sympathy. In May 1904, at the age of
83, Clara Barton resigned as president
of the American Red Cross.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>In retirement she broke all ties
with the Red Cross but retained a
lively interest in its activities. She
often felt bitter about the events that
preceded her resignation, and she
particularly resented the way in
which new Red Cross members were
prejudiced against her&mdash;&ldquo;ignorant of
every fact, simply enemies by transmission.&rdquo;
She was also critical of the
way in which the new Red Cross
leaders approached relief work, especially
during the San Francisco earthquake
of 1906. A small note of satisfaction
is detected in a diary entry:
&ldquo;The President has withdrawn the
distribution of public moneys contributed
for San Francisco from the Red
Cross.... He finds he made a mistake
in giving too much power to the
Red Cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still, she usually wished the best
for the Red Cross. Her &ldquo;one great
desire&rdquo; was to &ldquo;leave my little immigrant
of twenty-seven years ago a
great National Institution.&rdquo; And she
hoped her successors would be
&ldquo;freed from the severity of toil, the
anguish of perplexity, uncertainty,
misunderstanding, and often privations,
which have been ours in the
past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of her last public efforts was
the formation, in 1905, of the National
First Aid Society, which
helped establish community aid programs.
&ldquo;I thought I had done my
country and its people the most humane
service it would ever be in my
power to offer,&rdquo; commented Barton,
&ldquo;But ... [the Red Cross] reached
only a certain class. All the accidents
concerning family life ... manufactories
and railroads ... were not
within its province. Hence the necessity
and the opportunity for this
broader work covering all.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="interlude">&ldquo;I Would Never Wear Undeserved Honors&rdquo;</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Clara Barton was one of the most decorated
women in United States history. In appreciation
of her courageous humanitarian services
she received ten badges and medals from foreign
countries. Many of these medals were
conferred upon her in person by such leaders
as Kaiser Wilhelm I of Germany and his
daughter Louise, the grand duchess of Baden.
In one instance, Abdul Mamed, the sultan of
Turkey, was so impressed with Barton&rsquo;s methods
of relief work that he accompanied his
medal with a message to the State Department:
if America desired to send further relief
to Turkey, please send Clara Barton and her
workers.</p>
<p>Although she was never officially honored
by the United States government, Barton received
many private medals and honorary
memberships from American organizations;
the Loyal Legion of Women of Washington,
D.C., the <i>Waffengenossen</i> (German-American
soldiers who took part in the Franco-Prussian
War), the Vanderbilt Benevolent Association
of South Carolina, and the Ladies of Johnstown,
Pennsylvania, were among those that
honored Clara Barton in this way. One award
she particularly valued was a medal presented
to her in 1882 by the International Committee
of the Red Cross, when America adopted the
Treaty of Geneva. Barton was also proud of
the numerous &ldquo;royal jewels&rdquo; which were gifts
of her friends the grand duchess of Baden, and
Augusta, empress of Germany. Barton&rsquo;s favorite
among these was a large amethyst, carved
in the shape of a pansy.</p>
<p>She enjoyed her decorations without apology.
They were in old boxes inside a &ldquo;simple
little wicker satchel,&rdquo; and she rarely let them
out of her sight. She even took them with her
when she traveled. Visitors to her Glen Echo
home were always eager to see the medals,
and Barton was eager to show them. She
would spend hours telling stories about the
decorations beginning with a gold Masonic emblem.
&ldquo;My father gave it to me when I started
for the front (during the Civil War),&rdquo; Barton
would say, &ldquo;and I have no doubt that it protected
me on many an occasion.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many of her favorite tales involved the Iron
Cross of Germany; one of these took place in
Massachusetts. She had been invited to a ball
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
at which she wore a number of her medals. &ldquo;I
was being whirled around the ballroom by
some gallant or other when I saw three German
officers looking curiously at me as I
passed. I wondered for a moment but
promptly forgot about it until, as we swung
around the room again ... the music suddenly
stopped short. Everyone was gazing about bewilderedly,
when I saw three officers advancing
toward me and stopping, in front of me,
gave the full German military salute. I was
thoroughly astonished, but rallied enough to
return the salute, which I fortunately remembered.&rdquo;
Barton thought the whole situation
highly amusing. &ldquo;They did not know who I
was,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;they simply dared not
pass the Iron Cross without saluting it.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another humorous incident involved one of
Barton&rsquo;s royal jewels. Many of the decorations
were valuable in themselves, for they were
fashioned from gold and silver and set with
diamonds, sapphires, and exquisite enamel
work. However, one brooch in particular was
precious: a large smoky topaz set in gold, and
surrounded by 24 perfectly matched pearls, the
gift of the grand duchess of Baden. Once Barton
took the brooch to Tiffany&rsquo;s in New York
for repair. She was dressed simply, as was her
habit, and an efficient floorwalker suspected
that perhaps she was not the rightful owner of
the jewel. Eventually a manager was brought
in who recognized Barton and cleared up the
matter. He then expressed his admiration of
the topaz brooch, especially the 24 pearls.
Clara Barton liked to remember how astonished
the suspicious floorwalker was that &ldquo;such
a shabby woman should own such remarkable
jewels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barton enjoyed wearing her decorations as
much as talking about them and she nearly always
pinned on several before addressing an
audience, or attending a meeting. In her later
years she was often seen weeding the garden
or milking the cows with one or two medals
attached to her cotton workdress. On one occasion
she was nearly weighted down by simultaneously
wearing the Iron Cross, the Red
Cross of Geneva, the Masonic badge, the Silver
Cross of Serbia, and the extremely heavy
Empress Augusta Medal. Said Barton: &ldquo;They
do brighten up the old dress.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="interlude">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>The business of First Aid took up
much of her time, but she continued
her other interests. She attended and
spoke at suffrage conventions and
held a party for 400 feminists at her
Glen Echo home. But she viewed
with a jaundiced eye the arrival of
the &ldquo;suffragettes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Huge hats, dangerous
hatpins, hobble and harem
skirts,&rdquo; she observed in her diary of
1911, &ldquo;the conduct of the Suffragettes
are [<i>sic</i>] hard to defend.&rdquo; She
mourned the death of Susan B. Anthony
in 1906, and gave her final
public remarks on behalf of women
as a tribute to Anthony&rsquo;s memory:
&ldquo;A few days ago someone said in my
presence that every woman in the
world should stand with bared head
before Susan B. Anthony. Before I
had time to think I said, &lsquo;And every
man as well.&rsquo; I would not retract the
words. I believe her work is more for
the welfare of man than for that of
woman herself. Man is trying to
carry the burdens of the world alone.
When he had the efficient help of
woman he should be glad, and he
will be. Just now it is new and
strange, and men cannot comprehend
what it would mean. But when such
help comes, and men are used to it,
they will be grateful for it. The
change is not far away. This country
is to know woman suffrage, and it
will be a glad and proud day when it
comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>In the years that Clara Barton
spent at Glen Echo, she came
to love her house and yard.
Here Dr. Hubbell, Mary Hines,
the housekeeper, and Clara
Barton relax at the dinner table.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Barton was also kept busy by the
work of two households&mdash;the Glen
Echo house and a summer home in
North Oxford, Massachusetts. She
worked in the gardens, put up fruit
and vegetables, did her own laundry,
and even milked the cows. She also
continued her voluminous correspondence,
and wrote a slim autobiographical
volume, <i>The Story of My</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
<i>Childhood</i>. The book, published in
1907, was intended to be the first of
a series. The work of writing was
taxing, however, and she never finished
the second volume. But she remained
active. &ldquo;I still work many
hours, and walk many miles,&rdquo; she
proudly told friends in 1909. In her
diary she wrote that she had had &ldquo;a
hard day&rsquo;s work&mdash;but I am so thankful&mdash;so
grateful that I can do it, and
am not a helpless invalid to be
waited on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barton knew she was aging but
fought it. Privately she conceded that
&ldquo;there is a lack of coordination between
the brain and the limbs,&rdquo; but
publicly she resented any allusion to
her age. She disliked giving away recent
photographs of herself and
wished people would accept pictures
of her in &ldquo;strong middle life.&rdquo; She
also fooled nature&mdash;and many people&mdash;by
artistically covering her age.
A young relative was amazed to find
that Aunt Clara &ldquo;was very particular
about her make-up and in those days
there were few people who dared use
creams and rouge and powder, but
Aunt Clara used them skillfully and
the result was most amazingly good.
She looked years younger when she
had finished ... and her eyebrows
were treated with a pencil, if you
please.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next came the combing of her
coal black hair which, by the way,
had been dyed. Mother told me once
when she was with Aunt Clara when
she was sick for a long period and
couldn&rsquo;t have her hair attended to, it
was lovely and white, but she would
not have it so and wore it dyed black
to the very last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After her face and hair were finished
... [she] put on her waist, but
before buttoning it down the front,
she stuffed tissue paper all across the
front to make a nice rounded bust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was, in many ways, an eccentric
figure. Visitors were amused to
see her weed the garden, her chest
plastered with the decorations of foreign
governments. She was always an
individual in matters of dress, but
her costumes became more unusual
in her later years. Her favorite dress
color was green and she enjoyed
wearing a dash of red. One outfit
had five ill-matching shades of green
for skirt, sleeves, collar and bodice,
two kinds of lace, red ribbon, &ldquo;and
about the bottom ... was a strip of
the most awful old motheaten beaver
fur, about six inches wide.&rdquo; Financially,
she was quite well off, but in
the best New England tradition she
practiced economy in all things.</p>
<p>When a part of her dress wore out,
she apparently replaced it with whatever
material was on hand.</p>
<p>Most of Clara Barton&rsquo;s friends and
family died before her, and in her
last years she was often lonely. She
sometimes thought her achievements
were worthless beside the importance
of friendship. &ldquo;<i>What matters the
praise of the world?</i>&rdquo; Barton asked
herself in her journal on February 6,
1907, &ldquo;<i>and what matter after we leave
it especially? How hollow is that thing
called fame.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barton&rsquo;s loneliness heightened
what had been a mild interest in spiritualism.
She used faith healers and
urged them on others. From 1903 on
she was a champion of Christian Science
and was an outspoken defender
of Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of
Christian Science. She also dabbled
in astrology and became a firm believer
in spiritualistic seances. Much
of her time after 1907 was spent in
the company of a medium. With
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
complete sincerity Barton recorded
conversations with Lincoln, Grant,
and Sherman, with her family, and
with old friends Susan B. Anthony,
President McKinley, and Empress
Augusta of Germany. She relied on
these &ldquo;spirits&rdquo; for advice and persuaded
Dr. Hubbell to depend on
them, too. This had unfortunate repercussions.
After Barton&rsquo;s death,
Hubbell was taken in by a woman
who claimed to have made contact
with Barton&rsquo;s spirit. Hubbell was so
under the influence of this woman
that he actually gave her the house at
Glen Echo. It was several years and
court cases later before he got the
house back.</p>
<p>Clara Barton died on April 12,
1912, at the age of 90. She had endured
double-pneumonia twice in
one year and was too weak to recover
fully. Her last words, recalled
from a favorite poem, were &ldquo;Let me
go, let me go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was a remarkable woman. She
was neither the Christ-like figure Dr.
Hubbell idolized, nor the grasping
Red Cross potentate that others saw.
She was an individual capable of firm
action, strong beliefs, and an ability
to see a need clearly and fulfill it. To
everything she did&mdash;schoolteaching,
Civil War aid, and Red Cross
relief&mdash;she brought strong idealism
and unfailing energy. She was truly
exceptional.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>An exterior view of
the house at Glen Echo.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Clara Barton&rsquo;s house in Glen Echo owes its
existence to two unrelated facts: The 1889
Johnstown Flood and a plan for a housing development
at Glen Echo. In 1890, two brothers,
Edwin and Edward Baltzley, decided to
develop a cultural and intellectual residential
community in Glen Echo. The next year they
established a branch of the National Chautauqua,
an association dedicated to education and
productive recreation. The Baltzley brothers
approached Clara Barton and offered her a
plot of land and the workmen necessary to
build a structure if she would locate in their
community. They hoped that the attraction of
such a well-known personality as Barton would
be a testimonial to the soundness of their enterprise.</p>
<p>The proposal suited Barton perfectly, for
she was looking for a location on which she
could build a new headquarters building for
the Red Cross. After the Johnstown Flood she
and Dr. Julian Hubbell had had one of the
Red Cross warehouses dismantled and the
lumber shipped to Washington, D.C., where
she hoped to use it for the construction of the
new headquarters building. The Baltzleys&rsquo; offer
came just at the right moment and she accepted
immediately. Although it was understood
that it was Red Cross property, the land
was deeded directly to her. The whole transaction
was typical of the confusion that Barton
allowed to exist between her private possessions
and those of the Red Cross; she could
never clearly separate the two.</p>
<p>Dr. Hubbell supervised the construction of
the building, clearly following the lines of the
Johnstown structure. Here, however, he added
an extra flourish: a third floor &ldquo;lantern&rdquo; room
over the central well. In the summer of 1891
Barton and Hubbell moved in, but she found
daily travel to Washington, D.C., every day
too taxing and decided to use the house at
Glen Echo strictly as a warehouse.</p>
<p>In 1897 electric trolley lines made Glen
Echo more accessible to Washington, and she
decided once again to try living in Glen Echo.
Extensive remodeling made the house livable.
A stone facade originally built so that the Red
Cross headquarters would harmonize with the
nearby Chautauqua buildings, which were
never built, was removed and the house was
painted a warm yellow with brown trim.</p>

<p>The Glen Echo house was the headquarters
of the American National Red Cross from
1897 to 1904. As such it was the scene of much
official activity. But it was also a quiet retreat,
a farm, and a home. Chickens and a cow provided
food for the household that usually included
eight or nine staff members. Frequent
overnight guests and indigents sheltered by
Clara Barton swelled this number further. Her
horses, Baba and Prince, were housed in a stable,
and cats Tommy and Pussy roamed the
grounds. A large vegetable garden furnished
fresh produce. The grounds were a profusion
of flowers and vegetables mixed together. Visitors
noted that carrots and beets edged the
walkway out to the trolley stop. Beds of marigolds,
corn, roses, and tomatoes grew together.
Of particular pride to the owner were
the two varieties of Clara Barton rose that
were developed independently by two nurserymen:
Conrad Jones in West Grove, Pennsylvania,
and Mr. Hofmeister in Cincinnati, Ohio.
Strawberry plants sent to her by the grateful
farmers of Galveston, Texas, in appreciation
of her services after the disastrous hurricane
and tidal wave in 1900 provided great desserts
each June.</p>
<p>In 1909 Barton deeded the house to Dr.
Hubbell&mdash;perhaps in fear that the Red Cross
might try to reclaim the building after her
death. When she died in 1912, Dr. Hubbell together
with Mrs. John Logan and Gen. W.H.
Sears formed the Clara Barton Memorial Association.
They hoped to turn the house into a
monument to Barton&rsquo;s memory. They sold
memberships in the association to finance the
maintenance of the property but the response
was poor, and they soon ran into financial
problems.</p>
<p>The solution to their problems appeared to
be at hand when Mabelle Rawson Hirons
came on the scene. A native of North Oxford,
Massachusetts, she was an acquaintance of
Clara Barton and thus known to Hubbell and
his colleagues. She claimed that Barton had
appeared to her at a seance and told her to go
to Washington and take charge of the Glen
Echo house. This message &ldquo;from the beyond&rdquo;
and Mrs. Hirons&rsquo; assurances that she was
wealthy and would take care of all the financial
problems were all that the Memorial Association
members needed to receive her with
open arms. Even her demand that Dr. Hubbell
sign the deed over to her raised no doubts.</p>
<p>Within a short time it became startlingly apparent
that Mrs. Hirons was not about to pay
off the debts of the house. Instead she was using
the house to pay off <i>her</i> debts by selling
Barton&rsquo;s own furniture and renting out rooms.
Dr. Hubbell was evicted by Mrs. Hirons and
abandoned by members of the Memorial Association
who were disgusted with his failure to
understand what Mrs. Hirons was doing. He
had to fend for himself until a Mr. and Mrs.
Canada, owners of a local grocery store, took
him in. They persuaded him to sue Mrs. Hirons
in 1922, and four years later the courts
returned the house to him.</p>
<p>Dr. Hubbell died in 1929 and left the house
to two of his nieces, Rena and Lena Hubbell.
Only Rena lived in the house, which she ran
as a rooming house. In 1942 she and her sister
sold it to Josephine Frank Noyes, who had
come to Washington from Iowa. Mrs. Noyes
and her sister Henrietta Frank continued to
run it as a rooming house. They also urged
people to come and see &ldquo;Clara Barton&rsquo;s
House.&rdquo; They took care of the remaining original
furniture and even managed to acquire
some of the pieces that Mrs. Hirons had sold.</p>
<p>In 1958 Mrs. Noyes died and left the property
to her four sisters: Frances Frank, Henrietta
Frank, Katherine Frank Bronson, and
Sarah Frank Rhodes. By 1963 the sisters,
being quite elderly, felt that the house was too
big for them to keep up and decided to sell it.
The amusement park next door offered them
$50,000. The sisters feared that the house
would be torn down to enlarge the amusement
park&rsquo;s parking lot. Unhappy at such a possibility,
they decided to sell the house for $35,000
to anyone who would save and maintain the
property even though this would mean a financial
loss to themselves.</p>
<p>A group of Montgomery County, Maryland,
Red Cross volunteers met and proposed that
the American National Red Cross buy the
property and preserve it as a historic site. The
Red Cross replied that it could not use its
money for such a purpose, that its donations
could only go for disaster relief. The Red
Cross, however, did enthusiastically support
the preservation project and in May 1963
passed a resolution urging all Red Cross members
to support the fund-raising effort. On
May 28, 1963, this group incorporated itself as
the Friends of Clara Barton. They agreed to
pay the Frank sisters $1,000 by July 1963 to
secure the sale. A whirlwind of bake sales,
fashion shows, and other events had raised
only $800 by the deadline. Several members
went to talk to the Frank sisters to get an extension
of the deadline. As they were talking,
the amusement park&rsquo;s lawyer walked in and
handed one of the sisters a check for $50,000.
While they pondered whether to accept the
check or grant an extension, one of the
Friends ran into the house and burst into the
room with a check for $200. The Franks
handed the lawyer his $50,000 check and sent
him packing.</p>
<p>This was only the initial hurdle, for half of
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
the remaining $34,000, plus the settlement
costs had to be raised by January 1, 1964.
Public solicitation, two house tours, and two
benefits raised the amount and at the turn of
the year the Friends took possession. Later the
group bought all of Clara Barton&rsquo;s furniture in
the sisters&rsquo; possession.</p>
<p>In the succeeding years the Friends continued
to raise money and work on the house to
repair structural defects. In April 1965 the
house was designated a registered national
landmark. The Friends made their final payment
on the mortgage in early 1975. In April
they presented the deed to the National Park
Service in accordance with legislation passed
by Congress in October 1974 authorizing the
establishment of Clara Barton National Historic
Site.</p>
<p>In December 1979 the Friends disbanded
and donated the $8,435.37 remaining in their
treasury to the park to purchase furnishings for
the Red Cross Offices in the house. Their generosity
contributed substantially to the preservation
of this property and ensured its survival.</p>
<p>Since acquiring the property, the National
Park Service has done extensive research on
the building and its contents to determine the
proper course of the preservation efforts. Today,
work continues on the building and on
acquiring furnishings that reflect these findings.</p>
<p>The process of restoration is simultaneously
tedious and fascinating. Bit by bit the materials&mdash;wallpaper,
partitions, even bathrooms&mdash;added
after Clara Barton&rsquo;s time are removed,
revealing the original fabric of the building.
Newspapers found in the walls as insulation
are removed, flattened, and saved. Historic
floors, 1908 electrical wiring, and doorways
reappear. New questions arise as old ones are
answered. The sources are the house itself,
Clara Barton&rsquo;s diary and other writings, and a
collection of historic photographs. Each source
adds a different perspective to the restoration
of her home and to a better understanding of
her life.</p>
<p>Clara Barton National Historic Site is open
for guided tours on a limited basis. For details

<p><b>Andersonville National Historic Site</b>, Andersonville,
Georgia 31711. The park is the site of
the Confederate prison camp for Union prisoners
of war. In 1865 Clara Barton met Dorence
Atwater, a former prisoner at Andersonville,
while she was involved in her search for
missing men. Edwin M. Stanton, secretary of
war, approved of her plan to go to Andersonville
with Atwater and identify as many of the
graves as possible. Atwater&rsquo;s written record,
which he had kept during his imprisonment,
listed each man&rsquo;s name and the number that
marked his position in the trench; by comparing
this list with the cemetery&rsquo;s numbered
markers Barton had no trouble identifying
12,920 graves; 440 remained unknown. During
her stay in Andersonville, Barton wrote to
Secretary Stanton requesting that the former
prison grounds be turned into a national cemetery.
Stanton agreed and on August 17, 1865,
Barton raised the flag at the dedication.</p>
<p>The park museum contains an exhibit devoted
to the work of Barton and Atwater and
further explains their role in the establishment

<p><b>Antietam National Battlefield</b>, Box 158,
Sharpsburg, Maryland 21782. During the battle
of Antietam, Clara Baron attended and helped
a Pennsylvania surgeon tend to the Union
wounded. The location of this activity has
never been precisely determined, though it is
known that it did not take place on ground
currently owned by the park. Within the park
near stop 2 on the driving tour is a monument
erected by the Washington County, Maryland,
Red Cross chapter in honor of her work during
the battle. The park is located north and
east of Sharpsburg in west central Maryland
and contains the ground on which the bloody
September 17, 1862, battle was fought. It is

<p><b>Manassas National Battlefield Park</b>, Box 1830,
Manassas, Virginia 22110. During the battle of
Second Manassas, Clara Barton arrived in
Fairfax Station, Virginia, by train with supplies
for caring for the wounded. She joined a Federal
field hospital that had moved into the
hamlet ahead of the Union retreat. At St.
Mary&rsquo;s Roman Catholic Church in Fairfax Station
the Union doctors set up a hospital. Barton
arrived at the same time and contributed
medical help. She never reached the battlefield

<p><b>The American National Red Cross Headquarters</b>,
17th between D and E Streets, NW,
Washington, D.C. 20006. After Clara Barton
resigned as president, the Red Cross needed to
find a suitable place for its headquarters. After
spending some years in various unused rooms
in government office buildings, the U.S. Congress
approved legislation that provided $400,000
to match an equal amount raised privately
by Red Cross officials and that donated a city
block of land for a building. The land has remained
U.S. Government property although it
is in the perpetual custody of the American
Red Cross. The main building, which fronts on
17th Street, contains exhibit areas on the
ground and main floors. A library on the third
floor of the office building contains extensive
holdings about the Red Cross and related subjects.
The complex of buildings is open to the
public 8:30 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. Monday through
Friday.</p>

<p><b>Manuscript Reading Room, Library of Congress</b>,
10 First Street, SE, Washington, D.C.
20540. In the 1930s the Hubbell sisters were
doing some remodeling on the Clara Barton
House. In the process they discovered a
boarded-up corridor between two bedrooms.
When the corridor was reopened they found
the area filled with Clara Barton&rsquo;s personal papers,
diaries, scrapbooks, and other memorabilia
of her life and career. Who put them
there remains unknown. The two sisters presented
the entire cache to the Library of Congress.
The collection has been sorted and indexed

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
